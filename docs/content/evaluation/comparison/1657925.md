title: "[Q#1657887][A#1657925] How should I throw a divide by zero exception in Java without actually dividing by zero?"
---

https://stackoverflow.com/q/1657887

I have an I2C device that wants two inputs: a denominator and a numerator. Both are written to separate addresses, so no actual calculation (numerator/denominator) is done. The problem with this is that a divide by zero could occur on the I2C device, so a divide by zero error needs to be checked for. Ideally, exactly the same thing would happen if the dividing were done by the java code.
At the moment, I&#x27;ve bodged an unused variable that does the division, but I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;ll get optimized out:
Surely there&#x27;s a better way!

You should not throw an ArithmeticException. Since the error is in the supplied arguments, throw an IllegalArgumentException. As the documentation says:
Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
Which is exactly what is going on here.
