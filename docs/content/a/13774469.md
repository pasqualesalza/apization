In the 1 month experience I&#x27;ve had with any programming language, I&#x27;ve assumed that switch case conditions would accept anything in the parenthesis as a boolean checking thingamajig, ie
these:
Know what I mean?
something like
Sadly, doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way. I can&#x27;t have boolean checking in switch case.
Is there a way around it?
By the way, terribly sorry if I&#x27;m sounding confusing. I don&#x27;t quite know the names for everything in this language yet :X
Any answers appreciated

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13774469

You can achieve an OR for cases like this:
Cases are like a &quot;goto&quot; and multiple gotos can share the same line to start execution.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
switch (someChsr) {
case 'w':
case 'W':
    // some code for 'w' or 'W'
    break;
case 'x': // etc
}
```
