I read some articles written on &quot;ClassCastException&quot;, but I couldn&#x27;t get a good idea on that. Is there a good article or what would be a brief explanation?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/907367

Straight from the API Specifications for the ClassCastException:
Thrown to indicate that the code has
  attempted to cast an object to a
  subclass of which it is not an
  instance.
So, for example, when one tries to cast an Integer to a String, String is not an subclass of Integer, so a ClassCastException will be thrown.

```java
Object i = Integer.valueOf(42);
String s = (String)i;            // ClassCastException thrown here.
```
