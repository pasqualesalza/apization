In another Bruce Eckels exercise in calculating velocity, v = s / t where s and t are integers.  How do I make it so the division cranks out a float?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
class CalcV {
  float v;
  float calcV(int s, int t) {
    v = s / t;
    return v;
  } //end calcV
}

public class PassObject {

  public static void main (String[] args ) {
    int distance;
    distance = 4;

    int t;
    t = 3;

    float outV;

    CalcV v = new CalcV();
    outV = v.calcV(distance, t);

    System.out.println("velocity : " + outV);
  } //end main
}//end class
```

Just cast one of the two operands to a float first.
The cast has higher precedence than the division, so happens before the division.
The other operand will be effectively automatically cast to a float by the compiler because the rules say that if either operand is of floating point type then the operation will be a floating point operation, even if the other operand is integral.  Java Language Specification, ยง4.2.4 and ยง15.17

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
v = (float)s / t;
```
