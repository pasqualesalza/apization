Let me explain myself. By knowing the week number and the year of a date:
But now I don&#x27;t know how to get the date of the first day of that week. I&#x27;ve been looking in Calendar, Date, DateFormat but nothing that may be useful...
Any suggestion? (working in Java)


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Date curr = new Date();
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.setTime(curr);
int nweek = cal.WEEK_OF_YEAR;
int year = cal.YEAR;
```

Those fields does not return the values. Those are constants which identifies the fields in the Calendar object which you can get/set/add. To achieve what you want, you first need to get a Calendar, clear it and set the known values. It will automatically set the date to first day of that week.

That said, the java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar are epic failures. If you can, consider switching to Joda Time.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
// We know week number and year.
int week = 3;
int year = 2010;

// Get calendar, clear it and set week number and year.
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.clear();
calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, week);
calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year);

// Now get the first day of week.
Date date = calendar.getTime();
```
