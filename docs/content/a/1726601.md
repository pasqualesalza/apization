I was looking at the implementation of compare(double, double) in the Java standard library (6). It reads:
What are the merits of this implementation?
edit: &quot;Merits&quot; was a (very) bad choice of words. I wanted to know how this works.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static int compare(double d1, double d2) {
    if (d1 < d2)
        return -1;       // Neither val is NaN, thisVal is smaller
    if (d1 > d2)
        return 1;        // Neither val is NaN, thisVal is larger

    long thisBits = Double.doubleToLongBits(d1);
    long anotherBits = Double.doubleToLongBits(d2);

    return (thisBits == anotherBits ?  0 : // Values are equal
            (thisBits < anotherBits ? -1 : // (-0.0, 0.0) or (!NaN, NaN)
             1));                          // (0.0, -0.0) or (NaN, !NaN)
}
```

@Shoover&#x27;s answer is correct, but there is a bit more to it than this.
As the javadoc for Double::equals states:
&quot;This definition allows hash tables to operate properly.&quot;
Suppose that the Java designers had decided to implement equals(...) and compare(...) with the same semantics as == on the wrapped double instances.  This would mean that equals() would always return false for a wrapped NaN.  Now consider what would happen if you tried to use a wrapped NaN in a Map or Collection.
Doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense does it!
Other anomalies would exist because -0.0 and +0.0 have different bit patterns but are equal according to ==.
So the Java designers decided (rightly IMO) on the more complicated (but more intuitive) definition for these Double methods that we have today.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
List<Double> l = new ArrayList<Double>();
l.add(Double.NaN);
if (l.contains(Double.NaN)) {
    // this wont be executed.
}

Map<Object,String> m = new HashMap<Object,String>();
m.put(Double.NaN, "Hi mum");
if (m.get(Double.NaN) != null) {
    // this wont be executed.
}
