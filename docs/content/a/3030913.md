I&#x27;ve been beating my head against this absolutely infuriating bug for the last 48 hours, so I thought I&#x27;d finally throw in the towel and try asking here before I throw my laptop out the window.
I&#x27;m trying to parse the response XML from a call I made to AWS SimpleDB. The response is coming back on the wire just fine; for example, it may look like:
I pass in this XML to a parser with
and call eventReader.nextEvent(); a bunch of times to get the data I want.
Here&#x27;s the bizarre part -- it works great inside the local server. The response comes in, I parse it, everyone&#x27;s happy. The problem is that when I deploy the code to Google App Engine, the outgoing request still works, and the response XML seems 100% identical and correct to me, but the response fails to parse with the following exception:
I have double, triple, quadruple checked this XML for &#x27;invisible characters&#x27; or non-UTF8 encoded characters, etc. I looked at it byte-by-byte in an array for byte-order-marks or something of that nature. Nothing; it passes every validation test I could throw at it. Even stranger, it happens if I use a Saxon-based parser as well -- but ONLY on GAE, it always works fine in my local environment.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3030913

The encoding in your XML and XSD (or DTD) are different.
XML file header:  &lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;utf-8&#x27;?&gt;
XSD file header: &lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;utf-16&#x27;?&gt;
Another possible scenario that causes this is when anything comes before the XML document type declaration. i.e you might have something like this in the buffer:
or even a space or special character.
There are some special characters called byte order markers that could be in the buffer.
Before passing the buffer to the Parser do this...

String xml = "<?xml ...";
xml = xml.trim().replaceFirst("^([\\W]+)<","<");
