This is very odd to me.  RuntimeException inherits from Exception, which inherits from Throwable.
but
I know RuntimeException is special in that it&#x27;s unchecked. But to my understanding that applies just to whether exceptions have to be declared, not whether they are caught. And even then, I don&#x27;t know why this logic would break on catching Throwable.

```java
catch(Exception exc) { /* won't catch RuntimeException */
catch(Throwable exc) { /* will catch RuntimeException */
for(Callback cb : callbacks) {
    try {
        cb.call(item);
    }
    catch(Exception exc) {
        logger.error("Error in callback: ", exc);
   }

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/19164070

The premise of the question is flawed, because catching Exception does catch RuntimeException. Demo code:
Output:
Your loop will have problems if:
Perhaps that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing?

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new RuntimeException("Bang");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("I caught: " + e);
        }
    }
}
I caught: java.lang.RuntimeException: Bang
```
