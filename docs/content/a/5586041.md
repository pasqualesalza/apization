I want to display a Unicode character in Java.  If I do this, it works just fine:
String symbol = &quot;\u2202&quot;;
symbol is equal to &quot;∂&quot;.  That&#x27;s what I want.
The problem is that I know the Unicode number and need to create the Unicode symbol from that.  I tried (to me) the obvious thing:
However, in this case, symbol is equal to &quot;\u2202&quot;.  That&#x27;s not what I want.
How can I construct the symbol if I know its Unicode number (but only at run-time---I can&#x27;t hard-code it in like the first example)?

```java
int c = 2202;
String symbol =  "\\u" + c;
```


## Original code snippet

Just cast your int to a char. You can convert that to a String using Character.toString():
EDIT:
Just remember that the escape sequences in Java source code (the \u bits) are in HEX, so if you&#x27;re trying to reproduce an escape sequence, you&#x27;ll need something like int c = 0x2202.

```java
String s = Character.toString((char)c);
```
