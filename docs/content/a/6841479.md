If I run the following program, which parses two date strings referencing times 1 second apart and compares them:
The output is:
353
Why is ld4-ld3 not 1 (as I would expect from the one-second difference in the times), but 353?
If I change the dates to times 1 second later:
Then ld4-ld3 will be 1.

## Original code snippet

It&#x27;s a time zone change on December 31st in Shanghai.
See this page for details of 1927 in Shanghai. Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So &quot;1927-12-31 23:54:08&quot; actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the later possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference.
Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.
