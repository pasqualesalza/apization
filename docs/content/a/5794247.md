I&#x27;m currently dealing with a particular issue with my paid application.  Internally it contains a licensing check.  The app is patched by hackers by modifying the app apk/jar.  They are adding a new class which helps bypass the licensing check.
My goal is to somehow check for this particular patch.  If I find it I know my app has been compromised.
Any tips on how to know that something has been modified on the package?  Doing a hash over the app is not really an option in my case.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5794247

Not sure about android but in standard JDK you would do something like this:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
try {
 Class.forName( "your.fqdn.class.name" );
} catch( ClassNotFoundException e ) {
 //my class isn't there!
}
```
