Is there an easy way to extract the 0.321562 on it&#x27;s own from d? I tried looking in the math class but no luck. If this can be done without converting to string or casting to anything else, even better.

```java
double d = 4.321562;
```

Well, you can use:
Note that due to the way that binary floating point works, that won&#x27;t give you exactly 0.321562, as the original value isn&#x27;t exactly 4.321562. If you&#x27;re really interested in exact digits, you should use BigDecimal instead.

```java
double x = d - Math.floor(d);
```
