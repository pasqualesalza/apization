For accessing individual characters of a String in Java, we have String.charAt(2). Is there any inbuilt function to remove an individual character of a String in java?
Something like this:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if(String.charAt(1) == String.charAt(2){
   //I want to remove the individual character at index 2. 
}
```


## Original code snippet

You can also use the StringBuilder class which is mutable.
It has the method deleteCharAt(), along with many other mutator methods.
Just delete the characters that you need to delete and then get the result as follows:
This avoids creation of unnecessary string objects.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(inputString);
String resultString = sb.toString();
```
