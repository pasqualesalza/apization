I have never understood what is assert used for, even though I have read plenty examples, they don&#x27;t really let me know what or why should I use it for.
So Instead of asking an example, I&#x27;m gonna provide one and let me know if this is the proper usage of assert.
If this is correct, please let me know how to use it in this case. If this is not how it is supposed to use, please provide an example.

```java
// The idea is that the `mode` variable should be 0 or 1, and no other number.
switch(mode) {
     case 0: 
          // do stuff
          break;
     case 1:
          // do other stuff
          break;

     default:
          // assert code?
}
```


## Original code snippet

Not in this case.
If you&#x27;re asserting a value, you&#x27;re making a statement that, before some critical evaluation is done using this value, that it is what you assert it to be.  You can assert that the value isn&#x27;t null, or that it&#x27;s less than 2, or something before you reach your critical code block.
I would not encourage the use of that here.  Your code would not read well, and unless you enable assertions with the -ea flag, your assertion would not work.
Instead, what you can do is throw an exception of some kind - if it&#x27;s not 0 or 1, then the mode is an illegal value which cannot be processed, leading to exceptional/undefined behavior. Throw an exception of some kind.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
assert (mode >= 0 && mode < 2);  // Ensures that `mode` is between 0 and 1.
// Switch statement to follow
switch(mode) {
    case 0: 
        // do stuff
        break;
    case 1:
        // do other stuff
        break;
    default:
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Mode is illegal");
}
```
