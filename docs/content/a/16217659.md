I&#x27;m making a simple program that will deal with equations from a String input of the equation
When I run it, however, I get an exception because of trying to replace the &quot; +&quot; with a &quot; +&quot; so i can split the string at the spaces. How should I go about using
the string replaceAll method to replace these special characters? Below is my code
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Dangling meta character &#x27;+&#x27; near index 0
+
^

```java
public static void parse(String x){
       String z = "x^2+2=2x-1";

       String[] lrside =  z.split("=",4);
       System.out.println("Left side: " + lrside[0] + " / Right Side: " + lrside[1]);
       String rightside = lrside[0];
       String leftside = lrside[1];

       rightside.replaceAll("-", " -");
       rightside.replaceAll("+", " +");
       leftside.replaceAll("-", " -"); leftside.replaceAll("+", " +");
       List<String> rightt = Arrays.asList(rightside.split(" "));
       List<String> leftt = Arrays.asList(leftside.split(" "));

       System.out.println(leftt);
       System.out.println(rightt);

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16217659

replaceAll accepts a regular expression as its first argument.
+ is a special character which denotes a quantifier meaning one or more occurrences. Therefore it should be escaped to specify the literal character +:
(Strings are immutable so it is necessary to assign the variable to the result of replaceAll);
An alternative to this is to use a character class which removes the metacharacter status:
The simplest solution though would be to use the replace method which uses non-regex String literals:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
rightside = rightside.replaceAll("\\+", " +");
rightside = rightside.replaceAll("[+]", " +");
rightside = rightside.replace("+", " +");
```
