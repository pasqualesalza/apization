I am trying to make a typing adventure kind of game in java, however i need a command at least similar to the one in the title, here is the code
Whenever the user types something else than required, the default case happens, but i need it to go back to the start of the loop, so the user can type one of the other cases.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyFirstGameInJava {

public static void main(String[] args) {

System.out.println("Greetings, Enter your name and you may start your quest!");
Scanner Username = new Scanner(System.in);
String name = Username.nextLine();
System.out.println("Greetings " + name );
System.out.println("Welcome to an Unnamed Typing Advanture");
System.out.println("You find yourself on an island with very few trees, you can either hit a tree, or walk along");

String sc = Username.nextLine();

switch(sc){

case "Hit tree":
System.out.println("A coconut falls from the tree");
System.out.println("You can either eat the coconut or throw it");
break;
case "Walk":
System.out.println("You walk for a mile and find a village");
System.out.println("The village appears empty, you can either scream to see if anybody is there, or you can keep walking");
break;
default :
System.out.println("Nothing happens...");
}   

String sc1 = Username.nextLine();


switch(sc1){

case "Eat coconut":
System.out.println("You ate the coconut and got poisoned");
System.out.println("You died...");
break;
case "Throw coconut":
System.out.println("By throwing the coconut, you awaken a tiger and he eats you");
System.out.println("You are dead");
break;
case "Scream":
System.out.println("As soon as you scream, a man shoots you down from a window from one of the houses");
System.out.println("You died...");
break;
case "Walk":
System.out.println("You walked through the village, and you find a boat and leave the island");
System.out.println("You win! Updates coming soon!");
break;
default:
System.out.print("Nothing happend");



}

}

You can use the continue statement to continue to the next iteration.
That said, I don&#x27;t see a loop in your sample code. You can loop with a for, while or do/while. The do/while loop executes at least once -- which is typically what you want to do when asking the user a question.
This Java tutorial for Branching Statements provides this example of a continue statement in a for loop.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
        // interested only in p's
        if (searchMe.charAt(i) != 'p')
            continue;

        // process p's
        numPs++;
    }
```
