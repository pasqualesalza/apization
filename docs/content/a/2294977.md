question_text: "I am writing a little code in J2ME. I have a class with a method setTableId(Short tableId). Now when I try to write setTableId(100) it gives compile time error. How can I set the short value without declaring another short variable? When setting Long value I can use setLongValue(100L) and it works. So, what does L mean here and what's the character for Short value? Thanks"
answer_text: "In Java integer literals are of type int unless they are suffixed with letter 'L' or 'l' (Capital L is preferred as lower case L is hard to distinguish from number 1). If suffixed with L, the literals are of type long. The suffix does not have any special name in the Java Language Specification. Neither is there suffixes for any other integer types. So if you need short or byte literal, they must be casted: In setLongValue(100L) you don't have to necessarily include L suffix because in this case the int literal is automatically widened to long. This is called widening primitive conversion in the Java Language Specification."

I am writing a little code in J2ME. I have a class with a method setTableId(Short tableId). Now when I try to write setTableId(100) it gives compile time error. How can I set the short value without declaring another short variable?
When setting Long value I can use setLongValue(100L) and it works. So, what does L mean here and what&#x27;s the character for Short value?
Thanks



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2294977

In Java integer literals are of type int unless they are suffixed with letter &#x27;L&#x27; or &#x27;l&#x27; (Capital L is preferred as lower case L is hard to distinguish from number 1). If suffixed with L, the literals are of type long.
The suffix does not have any special name in the Java Language Specification. Neither is there suffixes for any other integer types. So if you need short or byte literal, they must be casted:
In setLongValue(100L) you don&#x27;t have to necessarily include L suffix because in this case the int literal is automatically widened to long. This is called widening primitive conversion in the Java Language Specification.
