How do I know what version of Java is being run in Eclipse?
Is there a way to write code to find out?
Is &quot;JRE System Library [JavaSE-1.6]&quot; in &quot;Package Explorer&quot; the right version?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1944479

The one the eclipse run in is the default java installed in the system (unless set specifically in the eclipse.ini file, use the -vm option). You can of course add more Java runtimes and use them for your projects
The string you&#x27;ve written is the right one, but it is specific to your environment. If you want to know the exact update then run the following code:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class JavaVersion {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.runtime.version"));
  }
}
```
