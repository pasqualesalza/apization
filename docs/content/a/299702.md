What&#x27;s the difference?



## Original code snippet

From Understanding Weak References, by Ethan Nicholas:
Weak references
A weak reference, simply put, is a
  reference that isn&#x27;t strong enough to
  force an object to remain in memory.
  Weak references allow you to leverage
  the garbage collector&#x27;s ability to
  determine reachability for you, so you
  don&#x27;t have to do it yourself. You
  create a weak reference like this:
and then
  elsewhere in the code you can use
  weakWidget.get() to get the actual
  Widget object. Of course the weak
  reference isn&#x27;t strong enough to
  prevent garbage collection, so you may
  find (if there are no strong
  references to the widget) that
  weakWidget.get() suddenly starts
  returning null.
...
Soft references
A soft reference is exactly like a
  weak reference, except that it is less
  eager to throw away the object to
  which it refers. An object which is
  only weakly reachable (the strongest
  references to it are WeakReferences)
  will be discarded at the next garbage
  collection cycle, but an object which
  is softly reachable will generally
  stick around for a while.
SoftReferences aren&#x27;t required to
  behave any differently than
  WeakReferences, but in practice softly
  reachable objects are generally
  retained as long as memory is in
  plentiful supply. This makes them an
  excellent foundation for a cache, such
  as the image cache described above,
  since you can let the garbage
  collector worry about both how
  reachable the objects are (a strongly
  reachable object will never be removed
  from the cache) and how badly it needs
  the memory they are consuming.
And Peter Kessler added in a comment:
