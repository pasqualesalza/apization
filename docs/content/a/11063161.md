I wanted code to convert all the characters in strings to uppercase or lowercase in Java.
I found a method that goes something like this:
Now I&#x27;ve read that using certain Locales, like Turkish, &quot;returns i (without dot) instead of i (with dot).&quot;
Is it safe to use Locales like UK, US, ENGLISH, etc.? Are there any big differences between them when applied to strings?
Which is the most preferred Locale for Strings?

}

I think you should use locale ,
For instance, &quot;TITLE&quot;.toLowerCase() in a Turkish locale returns
  &quot;tıtle&quot;, where &#x27;ı&#x27; is the LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I character. To
  obtain correct results for locale insensitive strings, use
  toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).
I refer to these links as solution to your problem
and it has point to keep in mind in you situation &quot;Turkish&quot;
toLowerCase() respects internationalization (i18n). It performs the
  case conversion with respect to your Locale. When you call
  toLowerCase(), internally toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()) is getting
  called. It is locale sensitive and you should not write a logic around
  it interpreting locale independently.
In the above program, look at the string length before and after
  conversion. It will be 1 and 3. Yes the length of the string before
  and after case conversion is different. Your logic will go for a toss
  when you depend on string length on this scenario. When your program
  gets executed in a different environment, it may fail. This will be a
  nice catch in code review.
To make it safer, you may use another method
  toLowerCase(Locale.English) and override the locale to English always.
  But then you are not internationalized.
So the crux is, toLowerCase() is locale specific.
