When I read the xml through a URL&#x27;s InputStream, and then cut out everything except the url, I get &quot;http://cliveg.bu.edu/people/sganguly/player/%20Rang%20De%20Basanti%20-%20Tu%20Bin%20Bataye.mp3&quot;.
As you can see, there are a lot of &quot;%20&quot;s.
I want the url to be unescaped.
Is there any way to do this in Java, without using a third-party library?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/624002

This is not unescaped XML, this is URL encoded text. Looks to me like you want to use the following on the URL strings.
This will give you the correct text. The result of decoding the like you provided is this.
The %20 is an escaped space character. To get the above I used the URLDecoder object.

```java
URLDecoder.decode(url);
