At line 53 it is giving me an error of else without if. I clearly have an if statement, but i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing wrong to make java not recognize it. I&#x27;ve tried moving around the braces and nothing is working.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/19284945

Here&#x27;s the problem:
That trailing ; is making Java believe that the if statement is finished, and the {} block after it is outside the if condition, consequently the else part has no matching if preceding it.
This is a rather frequent bug, and a hard one to spot. If it weren&#x27;t for the else block, the code would have compiled correctly, but it would have been wrong. Bottom line: never, ever put a ; in the opening line of an if, for or while statement.
