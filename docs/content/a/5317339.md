I have never done regex before, and I have seen they are very useful for working with strings. I saw a few tutorials (for example) but I still cannot understand how to make a simple Java regex check for hexadecimal characters in a string.
The user will input in the text box something like: 0123456789ABCDEF and I would like to know that the input was correct otherwise if something like XTYSPG456789ABCDEF when return false.
Is it possible to do that with a regex or did I misunderstand how they work?



## Original code snippet

Yes, you can do that with a regular expression:
Explanation:
To use this regular expression in Java you can for example call the matches method on a String:
Note that matches finds only an exact match so you don&#x27;t need the start and end of line anchors in this case. See it working online: ideone
You may also want to allow both upper and lowercase A-F, in which case you can use this regular expression:

```java
boolean isHex = s.matches("[0-9A-F]+");
```
