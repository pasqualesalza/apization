## Original code snippet

What do you mean by &quot;the count&quot;? The number of elements with a non-zero value? You&#x27;d just have to count them.
There&#x27;s no distinction between that array and one which has explicitly been set with zero values. For example, these arrays are indistinguishable:
Arrays in Java always have a fixed size - accessed via the length field. There&#x27;s no concept of &quot;the amount of the array currently in use&quot;.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int[] x = { 0, 0, 0 };
int[] y = new int[3];
```
