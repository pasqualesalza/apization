I have a double (23.46)
And using the methods Math.ceil and Math.floor and parsing my double to these methods, I get the same value returned to me, which is 23...
I want it to be rounded off to 24.. In otherwords, if I have a double that&#x27;s 15.01, it should still be rounded off to 16... How do I do this?
