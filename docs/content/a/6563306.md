Imagine an instance of BigInteger, then how to initialize it after creating instance?
For example:
How to put a value in t?
If the constructor cannot be called, then what can be done, to put the value in the object?

```java
BigInteger t = new BigInteger();

I&#x27;m not 100% sure of what specifically is confusing you as you&#x27;d initialize the items in the BigInteger array as you would any other object array. e.g.,
Edit 1:
Ah, now I understand your problem: you want to create a BigInteger instance and then later set its value.  The answer is the same as for Strings: you can&#x27;t, and that it is because BigIntegers like Strings are immutable and can&#x27;t be changed once created. For this reason the class has no &quot;setter&quot; methods. The way to change the value of a BigInteger variable is to set it to a new BigInteger instance.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
BigInteger t2 [] = new BigInteger[2];

  t2[0] = new BigInteger("2");
  t2[1] = BigInteger.ZERO; // ZERO, ONE, and TEN are defined by constants

  // or

  BigInteger[] t3 = {new BigInteger("2"), BigInteger.ZERO};
```
