I get these errors:
it seems to me that i initialized them at the top of the method. Whats going wrong?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static Rand searchCount (int[] x) 
{
    int a ; 
    int b ; 

    ...   

    for (int l= 0; l<x.length; l++) 
    {
        if (x[l] == 0) 
        a++ ;
        else if (x[l] == 1) 
        b++ ;
    }

    ...   

}
Rand.java:72: variable a might not have been initialized
                a++ ;
                ^
Rand.java:74: variable b might not have been initialized
                b++ ;
                ^
2 errors
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2448857

You declared them, but you didn&#x27;t initialize them. Initializing them is setting them equal to a value:
You get the error because you haven&#x27;t initialized the variables, but you increment them (e.g., a++) in the for loop.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int a;        // This is a declaration
a = 0;        // This is an initialization
int b = 1;    // This is a declaration and initialization
```
