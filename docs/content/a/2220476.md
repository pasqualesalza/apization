Is there any way in Java so that I can get Unicode equivalent of any character? e.g.
Suppose a method getUnicode(char c). A call getUnicode(&#x27;÷&#x27;) should return \u00f7.

You can do it for any Java char using the one liner here:
But it&#x27;s only going to work for the Unicode characters up to Unicode 3.0, which is why I precised you could do it for any Java char.
Because Java was designed way before Unicode 3.1 came and hence Java&#x27;s char primitive is inadequate to represent Unicode 3.1 and up: there&#x27;s not a &quot;one Unicode character to one Java char&quot; mapping anymore (instead a monstrous hack is used).
So you really have to check your requirements here: do you need to support Java char or any possible Unicode character?
