I haven&#x27;t had the chance to take any serious low-level programming courses in school. (I know I really should get going on learning the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; to be a better programmer.) I appreciate the conveniences of Java, including the ability to stick anything into a System.out.print statement. However, is there any reason why you would want to use System.out.printf instead?
Also, should I avoid print calls like this in &quot;real applications&quot;?  It&#x27;s probably better to  to print messages to the client&#x27;s display using some kind of UI function, right?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/548287

The printf method of the PrintStream class provides string formatting similar to the printf function in C.
The formatting for printf uses the Formatter class&#x27; formatting syntax.
The printf method can be particularly useful when displaying multiple variables in one line which would be tedious using string concatenation:
Also, writting Java applications doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean writing GUI applications, so when writing console applications, one would use print, println, printf and other functions that will output to System.out.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

// Tedious string concatenation.
System.out.println("a: " + a + " b: " + b);

// Output using string formatting.
System.out.printf("a: %d b: %d\n", a, b);
```
