I&#x27;m trying to convert a Milliseconds date to number of years months weeks and days.
For example: 5 months, 2 weeks and 3 days or 1 year and 1 day.
I don&#x27;t want: 7 days or 4 weeks &gt; this should be 1 week and 1 month.
I tried few ways but it always became something like 7 days and 0 weeks.
My code:
I have to add 1 to number of days because if I have 23 hours it should be 1 day.
Please explain how to convert it correctly, I think that there is more efficient ways to do it.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int weeks = (int) Math.abs(timeInMillis / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 7));
int days = (int) timeInMillis / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)+1);
```

I always use this for getting years etc from milliseconds and vice versa. Till now I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Hope it helps.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.util.Calendar;

Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance(); 
//Set time in milliseconds
c.setTimeInMillis(milliseconds);
int mYear = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
int mMonth = c.get(Calendar.MONTH); 
int mDay = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
int hr = c.get(Calendar.HOUR);
int min = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE);
int sec = c.get(Calendar.SECOND);
```
