The trim() function removes both the trailing and leading space, however, if I only want to remove the trailing space of a string, how can I do it?
Thanks!



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16974310

Using the regular expression \s++$, you can replace all trailing space characters (includes space and tab characters) with nothing (&quot;&quot;).
Output
Online demo.
Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the regex:
Thus, the regular expression will match as much whitespace as it can that is followed directly by the end of the string: in other words, the trailing whitespace.
The investment into learning regular expressions will become more valuable, if you need to extend your requirements later on.
