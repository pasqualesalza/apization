For Example I have the date: &quot;23/2/2010&quot; (23th Feb 2010). I want to pass it to a function which would return the day of week. How can I do this?
In this example, the function should return String &quot;Tue&quot;.
Additionally, if just the day ordinal is desired, how can that be retrieved?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5270292

Yes.  Depending on your exact case:
You can use java.util.Calendar:
if you need the output to be Tue rather than 3 (Days of week are indexed starting at 1), instead of going through a calendar, just reformat the string:  new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;EE&quot;).format(date) (EE meaning &quot;day of week, short version&quot;)
if you have your input as string, rather than Date, you should use SimpleDateFormat to parse it: new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;dd/M/yyyy&quot;).parse(dateString)
you can use joda-time&#x27;s DateTime and call dateTime.dayOfWeek() and/or DateTimeFormat.
