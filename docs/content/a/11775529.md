Ok, I am new to Java and I&#x27;m encountering a problem. I&#x27;m trying to make the program start all over again from the main when a certain section of the switch statement has finished executing. This is my code:
After case one finishes executing, the program exits. How do I pass control back to the main so that it can start allover again until the user exits on purpose?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test{
public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    int ans;
    System.out.println("Choose an option");
    System.out.print("1: To see members\n2: To add member\n3: To delete a member\n Option: ");
    ans = input.nextInt();

    switch(ans){
        case 1:
        //code to see members
        break;
        case 2:
        //code to add members
        break;
        case 3:
        //code to delete members
        break;
        default:
        System.out.println("Invalid option");
        }
     }
 }

Try this one....

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test{
public static void main(String[] args){
boolean run = true;
while(run){
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    int ans;
    System.out.println("Choose an option");
    System.out.print("1: To see members\n2: To add member\n3: To delete a member\n4: To end the program\n Option: ");
    ans = input.nextInt();

    switch(ans){
        case 1:
        //code to see members
        break;
        case 2:
        //code to add members
        break;
        case 3:
        //code to delete members
        break;
        case 4:
        //it will end the program
        run=false;
        break;
        default:
        System.out.println("Invalid option");
        }
       }
     }
