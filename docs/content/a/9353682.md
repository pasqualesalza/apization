Essentially, if the number generated is 2.3 then if I subtract .5 it will then be 1.8 but the rounding function will make it 2, which is what I want. Or if the answer is 2.99999 and I subtract .5, the answer is 2.49999 which should round down to 2 which is what I want. My question is if the answer is 2 even and I subtract .5, the answer is now 1.5, so will it still round up to 2.
this is my line of code for this.

```java
temp1_1= Math.round(temp2_2/(360/temp_value)-.5);
```

Even simpler and potential faster
This will round towards 0.  Math.floor() rounds towards negative infinity. Math.round(x - 0.5) also rounds towards negative infinity.

```java
double d = 2.99999999;
long l = (long) d; // truncate to a whole number.
