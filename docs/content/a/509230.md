Eclipse is giving me a warning of the following form:
Type safety: Unchecked cast from Object to HashMap
This is from a call to an API that I have no control over which returns Object:
I&#x27;d like to avoid Eclipse warnings, if possible, since theoretically they indicate at least a potential code problem.  I haven&#x27;t found a good way to eliminate this one yet, though.  I can extract the single line involved out to a method by itself and add @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;) to that method, thus limiting the impact of having a block of code where I ignore warnings.  Any better options?  I don&#x27;t want to turn these warnings off in Eclipse.
Before I came to the code, it was simpler, but still provoked warnings:
Problem was elsewhere when you tried to use the hash you&#x27;d get warnings:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
HashMap<String, String> getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {
  HashMap<String, String> theHash = (HashMap<String, String>)session.getAttribute("attributeKey");
  return theHash;
}
HashMap getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {
  HashMap theHash = (HashMap)session.getAttribute("attributeKey");
  return theHash;
}
HashMap items = getItems(session);
items.put("this", "that");

Type safety: The method put(Object, Object) belongs to the raw type HashMap.  References to generic type HashMap<K,V> should be parameterized.
```

Wow; I think I figured out the answer to my own question.  I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth it! :)
The problem is the cast isn&#x27;t checked.  So, you have to check it yourself.  You can&#x27;t just check a parameterized type with instanceof, because the parameterized type information is unavailable at runtime, having been erased at compile time.
But, you can perform a check on each and every item in the hash, with instanceof, and in doing so, you can construct a new hash that is type-safe.  And you won&#x27;t provoke any warnings.
