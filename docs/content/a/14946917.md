I have everything setup already to store the current date to a variable in Java.  What I am trying to figure out is how to store a date of 1 year after the current date.
Here is what I have for the current date:
So if it were today for example it would store 2/18/2013.  I am trying to store the date 2/18/2014.  How would I go about doing this?

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.text.DateFormat;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Calendar;
DateFormat newDate = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/dd/yyyy");
Date date = new Date();
startDate = newDate.format(date);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/14946917

If you do not want to drag external libraries, just use calendar.add(Calendar.YEAR, 1)
Note, if the date was 29/Feb/2012 and you added 1 year, you will get 28/Feb/2013

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
Date today = cal.getTime();
cal.add(Calendar.YEAR, 1); // to get previous year add -1
Date nextYear = cal.getTime();
```
