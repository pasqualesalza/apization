I deploy a webapp on two different containers (Tomcat and Jetty), but their default servlets for serving the static content have a different way of handling the URL structure I want to use (details).
I am therefore looking to include a small servlet in the webapp to serve its own static content (images, CSS, etc.). The servlet should have the following properties:
Is such a servlet available somewhere? The closest I can find is example 4-10 from the servlet book.
Update: The URL structure I want to use - in case you are wondering - is simply:
So all requests should be passed to the main servlet, unless they are for the static path. The problem is that Tomcat&#x27;s default servlet does not take the ServletPath into account (so it looks for the static files in the main folder), while Jetty does (so it looks in the static folder).

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/132932

I ended up rolling my own StaticServlet. It supports If-Modified-Since, gzip encoding and it should be able to serve static files from war-files as well. It is not very difficult code, but it is not entirely trivial either.
The code is available: StaticServlet.java. Feel free to comment.
Update: Khurram asks about the ServletUtils class which is referenced in StaticServlet. It is simply a class with auxiliary methods that I used for my project. The only method you need is coalesce (which is identical to the SQL function COALESCE). This is the code:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static <T> T coalesce(T...ts) {
    for(T t: ts)
        if(t != null)
            return t;
    return null;
}
```
