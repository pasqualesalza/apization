What is the best way to check if a URL is valid in Java?
If tried to call new URL(urlString) and catch a MalformedURLException, but it seems to be happy with anything that begins with http://.
I&#x27;m not concerned about establishing a connection, just validity.  Is there a method for this?  An annotation in Hibernate Validator?  Should I use a regex?
Edit:  Some examples of accepted URLs are http://*** and http://my favorite site!.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2230770

Consider using the Apache Commons UrlValidator class
There are several properties that you can set to control how this class behaves, by default http, https, and ftp are accepted.

```java
UrlValidator urlValidator = new UrlValidator();
urlValidator.isValid("http://my favorite site!");
```
