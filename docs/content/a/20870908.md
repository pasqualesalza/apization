I am new to java, i know set is not allowed duplicate value but i don&#x27;t know why set is not allowed duplicate value, Actually i am doing practically,
Declared one set and add duplicate value but no kind of error is occurring, no compile time error, no run time. why?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/20870908

The meaning of &quot;sets do not allow duplicate values&quot; is that when you add a duplicate to a set, the duplicate is ignored, and the set remains unchanged. This does not lead to compile or runtime errors: duplicates are silently ignored.
You can tell that a value is a duplicate by checking the result of add, like this:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Set<String> testSet = new HashSet<String>();
boolean first = testSet.add("hello");
System.out.println(first);             // Prints "true"
boolean second = testSet.add("hello");
System.out.println(second);            // Prints "false"
```
