I made a method that takes a File and a String.  It replaces the file with a new file with that string as its contents.
This is what I made:
However it is painfully slow.  It sometimes takes over a minute.
How can I write large files with tens of thousands to maybe up to a million characters in them?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void Save(File file, String textToSave) {

    file.delete();
    try {
        BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));
        out.write(textToSave);
        out.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
    }
}
```

Make sure you allocate a large enough buffer:
What sort of OS are you running on?  That can make a big difference too.  However, taking a minute to write out a file of less-than-enormous size sounds like a system problem.  On Linux or other *ix systems, you can use things like strace to see if the JVM is making lots of unnecessary system calls. (A very long time ago, Java I/O was pretty dumb and would make insane numbers of low-level write() system calls if you weren&#x27;t careful, but when I say &quot;a long time ago&quot; I mean 1998 or so.)
