Here is my code. I am not sure how to exit the program using a return value. Any ideas? THis is the last step from my assignment.
Important areas are marked with ///////
I hear return works but when I change void in main to int, the program says main must be void.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13246758

As long as you don&#x27;t need to return custom exit code (other than 0, as returned by System.exit(0)) and don&#x27;t start new threads, you can terminate your program by doing
in your main() method. Note that there is no value returned, so that you don&#x27;t need to change your main() method from void to int.
