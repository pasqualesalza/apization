For example I&#x27;m extracting a text String from a text file and I need those words to form an array. However, when I do all that some words end with comma (,) or a full stop (.) or even have brackets attached to them (which is all perfectly normal).
What I want to do is to get rid of those characters. I&#x27;ve been trying to do that using those predefined String methods in Java but I just can&#x27;t get around it.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1962195

Use:
replaceAll takes a regular expression.  This:
...looks for each comma and/or period.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String str = "whatever";
str = str.replaceAll("[,.]", "");
[,.]
```
