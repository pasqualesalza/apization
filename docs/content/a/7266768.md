I have been using the following code to connect to one of google&#x27;s service. This code worked fine on my local machine :
I put this code in a production environment, which had blocked Google.com. On request, they allowed communication with Google server by allowing me to accessing an IP : 74.125.236.52 - which is one of Google&#x27;s IPs. I edited my hosts file to add this entry too.
Still I could not access the URL, which I wonder why. So I replaced the above code with :
Now I get an error like this :
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn&#x27;t match:
  &lt;74.125.236.52&gt; != &lt;www.google.com&gt;
I guess this is because Google has multiple IPs. I cant ask the network admin to allow me access to all those IPs - I may not even get this entire list.
What should I do now ? Is there a workaround at Java level ? Or is it totally in hands of the network guy ?

Thanks Vineet Reynolds. The link you provided held a lot of user comments - one of which I tried in desperation and it helped. I added this method :
This seems fine for me now, though I know this solution is temporary. I am working with the network people to identify why my hosts file is being ignored.

```java
// Do not do this in production!!!
HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier( new HostnameVerifier(){
    public boolean verify(String string,SSLSession ssls) {
        return true;
    }
});
