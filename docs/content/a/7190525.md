Can I read String Builder line by line? And Get the length of each line as well.
EDIT:
&quot;I build string in StringBuilder and add &quot;\n&quot; within. And I need to read it again. I need to consider that every &quot;\n&quot; has a new line.&quot;

Given your edit, it&#x27;s as simple as invoking toString() on the StringBuilder instance, and then invoking split(&quot;\\n&quot;) on the returned String instance. And from there, you&#x27;ll have a String array that you can loop through to access each &quot;line&quot; of the StringBuilder instance. And of course, invoke length() on each String instance, or &quot;line&quot; to get its length.

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("line 1");
sb.append("\\n");
sb.append("line 2");

String[] lines = sb.toString().split("\\n");
for(String s: lines){
    System.out.println("Content = " + s);
    System.out.println("Length = " + s.length());
}
```
