It seems to be impossible to make a cached thread pool with a limit to the number of threads that it can create.
Here is how static Executors.newCachedThreadPool is implemented in the standard Java library:
So, using that template to go on to create a fixed sized cached thread pool:
Now if you use this and submit 3 tasks, everything will be fine.  Submitting any further tasks will result in rejected execution exceptions.
Trying this:
Will result in all threads executing sequentially.  I.e., the thread pool will never make more than one thread to handle your tasks.
This is a bug in the execute method of ThreadPoolExecutor?  Or maybe this is intentional?  Or there is some other way?
Edit: I want something exactly like the cached thread pool (it creates threads on demand and then kills them after some timeout) but with a limit on the number of threads that it can create and the ability to continue to queue additional tasks once it has hit its thread limit.

```java
public static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool() {
    return new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE,
                                  60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                                  new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>());
}
new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, 3, 60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new SynchronusQueue<Runable>());
new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, 3, 60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runable>());

The ThreadPoolExecutor has the following several key behaviors, and your problems can be explained by these behaviors.
When tasks are submitted,
In the first example, note that the SynchronousQueue has essentially size of 0.  Therefore, the moment you reach the max size (3), the rejection policy kicks in (#4).
In the second example, the queue of choice is a LinkedBlockingQueue which has an unlimited size.  Therefore, you get stuck with behavior #2.
You cannot really tinker much with the cached type or the fixed type, as their behavior is almost completely determined.
If you want to have a bounded and dynamic thread pool, you need to use a positive core size and max size combined with a queue of a finite size.  For example,

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(10, // core size
    50, // max size
    10*60, // idle timeout
    TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(20)); // queue with a size
```
