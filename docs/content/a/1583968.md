How do I get up to the first n characters of a string in Java without doing a size check first (inline is acceptable) or risking an IndexOutOfBoundsException?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1583968

Here&#x27;s a neat solution:
Opinion: while this solution is &quot;neat&quot;, I think it is actually less readable than a solution that uses if / else in the obvious way.  If the reader hasn&#x27;t seen this trick, he/she has to think harder to understand the code.  IMO, the code&#x27;s meaning is more obvious in the if / else version.  For a cleaner / more readable solution, see @paxdiablo&#x27;s answer.

```java
String upToNCharacters = s.substring(0, Math.min(s.length(), n));
```
