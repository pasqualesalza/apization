I&#x27;m a .Net developer but somehow I was task to create a simple application in java for some extra reason. I was able to create that application but my problem is how can i center the form in the screen when the application is launched?
Here is my code:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
private void formWindowActivated(java.awt.event.WindowEvent evt) 
{
        // Get the size of the screen
        Dimension dim = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();

        // Determine the new location of the window
        int w = this.getSize().width;
        int h = this.getSize().height;
        int x = (dim.width-w)/2;
        int y = (dim.height-h)/2;

        // Move the window
        this.setLocation(x, y);
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/9543339

Simply set location relative to null after calling pack on the JFrame, that&#x27;s it.
e.g.,

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame("FooRendererTest");
  frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
  frame.getContentPane().add(mainPanel); // or whatever...
  frame.pack();
  frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);  // *** this will center your app ***
  frame.setVisible(true);
```
