I am trying to write data to a csv file with java, however when I try opening the produced file with excel I am getting an error saying the file is corrupt. Upon opening the file in notepad it looks to be formatted correctly so I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is. I am using the FileWriter class to output the data to the file.
Do I need to use some library in java in order to print to a csv file? I presumed you could just do this natively in java as long as you used the correct formatting.
Appreciate the help,

```java
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("test.csv");

writer.append("ID");
writer.append(',');
writer.append("name");
writer.append(',');
...
writer.append('\n');

writer.flush();
writer.close();
```

Basically it&#x27;s because MS Excel can&#x27;t decide how to open the file with such content.
When you put ID as the first character in a Spreadsheet type file, it matches the specification of a SYLK file and MS Excel (and potentially other Spreadsheet Apps) tries to open it as a SYLK file. But at the same time, it does not meet the complete specification of a SYLK file since rest of the values in the file are comma separated. Hence, the error is shown.
To solve the issue, change &quot;ID&quot; to &quot;id&quot; and it should work as expected.

This is weird. But, yeah!
Also trying to minimize file access by using file object less.
I tested and the code below works perfect.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;


public class CSV {
    public static void main(String[]args) throws FileNotFoundException{
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new File("test.csv"));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("id");
        sb.append(',');
        sb.append("Name");
        sb.append('\n');

        sb.append("1");
        sb.append(',');
        sb.append("Prashant Ghimire");
        sb.append('\n');

        pw.write(sb.toString());
        pw.close();
        System.out.println("done!");
    }
}
