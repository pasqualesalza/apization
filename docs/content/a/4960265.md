How come this happens:

Thanks in advance for answering this little ignorant question of mine. :P

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
char a = '\uffff'; //Highest value that char can take - 65535
byte b = (byte)a; //Casting a 16-bit value into 8-bit data type...! Isn't data lost here?
char c = (char)b; //Let's get the value back
int d = (int)c;
System.out.println(d); //65535... how?
```

As trojanfoe states, your confusion on the results of your code is partly due to sign-extension.  I&#x27;ll try to add a more detailed explanation that may help with your confusion.
As you noted, this DOES result in the loss of information.  This is considered a narrowing conversion.  Converting a char to a byte &quot;simply discards all but the n lowest order bits&quot;.
The result is:  0xFFFF -&gt; 0xFF
Converting a byte to a char is considered a special conversion.  It actually performs TWO conversions.  First, the byte is SIGN-extended (the new high order bits are copied from the old sign bit) to an int (a normal widening conversion).  Second, the int is converted to a char with a narrowing conversion.
The result is:  0xFF -&gt; 0xFFFFFFFF -&gt; 0xFFFF
Converting a char to an int is considered a widening conversion.  When a char type is widened to an integral type, it is ZERO-extended (the new high order bits are set to 0).
The result is:  0xFFFF -&gt; 0x0000FFFF.  When printed, this will give you 65535.
