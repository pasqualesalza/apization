I have a string that contains a character ï¿½ I haven&#x27;t been able to replace it correctly.
String.replace(&quot;ï¿½&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
doesn&#x27;t work, does anyone know how to remove/replace the ï¿½ in the string??



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1489555

That&#x27;s the Unicode Replacement Character, \uFFFD.  (info)
Something like this should work:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String strImport = "For some reason my �double quotes� were lost.";
strImport = strImport.replaceAll("\uFFFD", "\"");
```
