I have a program that runs in a few threads. The main thread shares an object with the other threads and in the main I have a call to:
I have a suspicion that the main thread is starved and isn&#x27;t getting access to obj. How do I raise the priority of the main thread or is it already higher than the other threads by default?

```java
synchronized(obj){
    do stuff
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1617994

You have a setPriority() method in the Thread class.
Check this javadoc.
Setting thread priority to maximum:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
    Thread.currentThread().setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
    // Your main code.
}
```
