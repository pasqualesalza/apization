If the following code is possible:
Does it mean that a function returning a possible null value for an integer is a bad practice?
Edit 1:
There are several different opinions in these answers. I am not enough confident to choose one or another.

That code will give a NullPointerException when you run it. It&#x27;s basically equivalent to:
... which makes it clearer that it will indeed fail.
You&#x27;re not really assigning a null value to an int - you&#x27;re trying and failing.
It&#x27;s fine to use null as a value for an Integer; indeed often Integer is used instead of int precisely as a &quot;nullable equivalent`.
