for(int i=0;i<hello.length;i++) {
    String s=hello[i].toLowerCase().trim();
    System.out.println(""+s+"");

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15305986

Because double quotes delimit String values, naturally you must escape them to code a literal double quote, however you can do it without escaping like this:
Here, the double quote characters (&quot;) have been coded as char values. I find this style easier and cleaner to read than the &quot;clumsy&quot; backslashing approach. However, this approach may only be used when a single character constant is being appended, because a &#x27;char&#x27; is (of course) exactly one character.

```java
System.out.println('"' + s + '"');
```
