In C#, if you want a method to have an indeterminate number of parameters, you can make the final parameter in the method signature a params so that the method parameter looks like an array but allows everyone using the method to pass as many parameters of that type as the caller wants.
I&#x27;m fairly sure Java supports similar behaviour, but I cant find out how to do it.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/519756

In Java it&#x27;s called varargs, and the syntax looks like a regular parameter, but with an ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;) after the type:
The vararg parameter must always be the last parameter in the method signature, and is accessed as if you received an array of that type (e.g. Object[] in this case).
