I&#x27;m using NetBeans, trying to change the familiar Java coffee cup icon to a png file that I have saved in a resources directory in the jar file.  I&#x27;ve found many different web pages that claim they have a solution, but so far none of them work.
Here&#x27;s what I have at the moment (leaving out the try-catch block):
The class that contains this code is in the com.xyz package, if that makes any difference.  That class also extends JFrame.  This code is throwing a MalformedUrlException on the first line.
Anyone have a solution that works?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
URL url = new URL("com/xyz/resources/camera.png");
Toolkit kit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
Image img = kit.createImage(url);
getFrame().setIconImage(img);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/209824

May or may not require a &#x27;/&#x27; at the front of the path.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
java.net.URL url = ClassLoader.getSystemResource("com/xyz/resources/camera.png");
```
