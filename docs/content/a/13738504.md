I need to create a List that records two columns {int, String}. I think ArrayList is what I need but I cant get my head around it. I pulled the Strings from a database and the int is the index value which I need to identify the strings position for later.
List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; strArray = ArrayList&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;;
then could I do something like strArray.add().add() for each row I pull from the database?



## Original code snippet

I think you should use a HashMap with int as key and String as value if your int values are going to be unique.
Note that as Map is a collections and java collections do not store primitive like int, they store objects so you have to use Integer wrapper class for your int values.
Refer this link Why can Java Collections not directly store Primitives types?
