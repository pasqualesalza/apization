How do you check if a one-character String is a letter - including any letters with accents?
I had to work this out recently, so I&#x27;ll answer it myself, after the recent VB6 question reminded me.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/93979

Just checking if a letter is in A-Z because that doesn&#x27;t include letters with accents or letters in other alphabets.
I found out that you can use the regular expression class for &#x27;Unicode letter&#x27;, or one of its case-sensitive variations:
You can also do this with Character class:
but that is less convenient if you need to check more than one letter.

```java
string.matches("\\p{L}"); // Unicode letter
string.matches("\\p{Lu}"); // Unicode upper-case letter
Character.isLetter(character);
```
