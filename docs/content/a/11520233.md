I want to know the basic difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() for shutting down the Executor Service ?As far as I understood shutdown() should be used for graceful shutdown which means all tasks that were runing and queued for processing but not started should be allowed to complete and shutdownNow() does an abrupt shut down meaning that some unfinished tasks are cancelled and unstarted tasks are also cancelled  . Is there anything else which is implicit/explicit  that I am missing ?
P.S: I found another question on SO related to this but not exactly what I want know .



## Original code snippet

In summary, you can think of it that way:
You can try the example below and replace shutdown by shutdownNow to better understand the different paths of execution:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
    executor.submit(new Runnable() {

        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                    System.out.println("interrupted");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    });

    executor.shutdown();
    if (!executor.awaitTermination(100, TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS)) {
        System.out.println("Still waiting after 100ms: calling System.exit(0)...");
        System.exit(0);
    }
    System.out.println("Exiting normally...");
}
```
