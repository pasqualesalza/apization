I am trying to understand the difference between matches() and find().
According to the Javadoc, (from what I understand), matches() will search the entire string even if it finds what it is looking for, and find() will stop when it finds what it is looking for.
If that assumption is correct, I cannot see whenever you would want to use matches() instead of find(), unless you want to count the number of matches it finds.
In my opinion the String class should then have find() instead of matches() as an inbuilt method.
So to summarize:



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4450166

matches tries to match the expression against the entire string and implicitly add a ^ at the start and $ at the end of your pattern, meaning it will not look for a substring. Hence the output of this code:
123 is a substring of a123b so the find() method outputs true. matches() only &#x27;sees&#x27; a123b which is not the same as 123 and thus outputs false.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {
    Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\d\\d\\d");
    Matcher m = p.matcher("a123b");
    System.out.println(m.find());
    System.out.println(m.matches());

    p = Pattern.compile("^\\d\\d\\d$");
    m = p.matcher("123");
    System.out.println(m.find());
    System.out.println(m.matches());
}

/* output:
true
false
true
true
*/
```
