What regex pattern would need I to pass to the java.lang.String.split() method to split a String into an Array of substrings using all whitespace characters (&#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;\t&#x27;, &#x27;\n&#x27;, etc.) as delimiters?



## Original code snippet

Something in the lines of
This groups all white spaces as a delimiter.
So if I have the string:
&quot;Hello[space][tab]World&quot;
This should yield the strings &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World&quot; and omit the empty space between the [space] and the [tab].
As VonC pointed out, the backslash should be escaped, because Java would first try to escape the string to a special character, and send that to be parsed. What you want, is the literal &quot;\s&quot;, which means, you need to pass &quot;\\s&quot;. It can get a bit confusing.
The \\s is equivalent to [ \\t\\n\\x0B\\f\\r]
