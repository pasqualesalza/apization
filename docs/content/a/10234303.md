What is the most performant way to build strings from strings, integers and floats? currently I&#x27;m doing this and it uses a lot of cpu time.
Is there a way to do this faster?

```java
String frame = this.frameTime + ":" +
    this.player.vertices[0].x + "," +
    this.player.vertices[0].y + "," +
    this.player.activeAnimId + "," +
    (int)this.player.virtualSpeed + "," +
    this.map.getCurrentTime() + 
    (this.player.frameSound == -1 ? "" : "," + this.player.frameSound) +
    (this.player.frameDecal.equals("") ? "" : "," + this.player.frameDecal) +
    ";";
```


## Original code snippet

That should already be fast - it&#x27;ll use StringBuilder internally for concatenation. Arguably using StringBuilder explicitly could eliminate the concatenation of empty strings, but it&#x27;s not likely to make a big difference.
How often are you doing this, anyway? It must be pretty often, for it to be a bottleneck... do you really need to do it that often?
EDIT: For those who are saying &quot;Use StringBuilder, it&#x27;ll be faster&quot; - consider this code:
Compile that, then use javap -c to see what the compiler generates...

```java
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        int z = 30;
        String foo = x + "," + y + "," + z + ";";
        System.out.println(foo);
    }
}
