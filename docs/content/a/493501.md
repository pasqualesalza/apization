I have a Java method in which I&#x27;m summing a set of numbers. However, I want any negatives numbers to be treated as positives. So (1)+(2)+(1)+(-1) should equal 5.
I&#x27;m sure there is very easy way of doing this - I just don&#x27;t know how.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/493501

Just call Math.abs. For example:
Which will set x to 5.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int x = Math.abs(-5);
```
