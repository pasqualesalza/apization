I am getting a Cipher implementation with Cipher.getInstance(String algorithm).  I am under the impression that the available algorithm names that I may pass differ based on what libraries which are present in my classpath.
I would like to write a simple program that I can run with different classpaths that will list the available Cipher algorithm names.  What method would I need to call to get this list?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/9334357

Once I have a list of providers, as described in JB Nizet&#x27;s post, I still don&#x27;t have a list of algorithms.  I found that each Provider functions as a Properties object, and the Properties encode the algorithm names.  I&#x27;m not entirely clear on if this is the correct way to look for them or not, and what exactly all the other properties mean, but I just wrote a routine that spewed all properties to System.out and grepped for various strings describing what I was looking for until I found it.

```java
import java.security.*;

for (Provider provider: Security.getProviders()) {
  System.out.println(provider.getName());
  for (String key: provider.stringPropertyNames())
    System.out.println("\t" + key + "\t" + provider.getProperty(key));
}
```
