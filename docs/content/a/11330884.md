I know that Java have its own garbage collection, but sometimes I want to delete the garbage manually. Is there any way to do the work like that? And considering that I have a long or very long function which declares many variables, is this a good idea to delete the unused memory immediately after using instead of auto collection at the end of the function? If I delete garbage manually, does it affect the speed of my application? Thanks for helping!



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/11330884

There is no direct and immediate way to free memory in java. You might try to persuade the garbage collector to take away some object using the well known:
but there is no guarantee that this will actually free memory immediately.
While this applies to heap memory, stack allocated items can only be freed when the function returns.
