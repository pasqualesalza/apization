substring between two delimiters
I have a string like
&quot;ABC[ This is to extract ]&quot;
I want to extract the part &quot;This is to extract&quot; in java. I am trying to use split, but it is not working the way I want. Does anyone have suggestion?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13796501

If you have just a pair of brackets ( [] ) in your string, you can use indexOf():

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String str = "ABC[ This is the text to be extracted ]";    
String result = str.substring(str.indexOf("[") + 1, str.indexOf("]"));
```
