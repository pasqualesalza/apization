I would like to match:
But I don&#x27;t have any idea how.
I can match a single  part like this
How can I say &quot;repeat that&quot;

some.name.separated.by.dots
\w+\.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4739777

Try the following:
The + after ( ... ) tell it to match what is inside the parenthesis one or more times.
Note that \w only matches ASCII characters, so a word like café wouldn&#x27;t be matches by \w+, let alone words/text containing Unicode.
The difference between [...] and (...) is that [...] always matches a single character. It is called a &quot;character set&quot; or &quot;character class&quot;. So, [abc] does not match the string &quot;abc&quot;, but matches one of the characters a, b or c.
The fact that \w+[\.\w+]* also matches your string is because [\.\w+] matches a . or a character from \w, which is then repeated zero or more time by the * after it. But, \w+[\.\w+]* will therefor also match strings like aaaaa or aaa............
The (...) is, as I already mentioned, simply used to group characters (and possible repeat those groups).

Here&#x27;s an example in Java (seeing you post mostly Java answers):
which will produce:
Note that m.group(0) and m.group() are equivalent: meaning &quot;the entire match&quot;.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
\w+(\.\w+)+
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "some.text.here only but not Some other " + 
                "there some.name.separated.by.dots and.we are done!";
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\w+(\\.\\w+)+");
        Matcher m = p.matcher(text);
        while(m.find()) {
            System.out.println(m.group());
        }
    }
}
some.text.here
some.name.separated.by.dots
and.we
