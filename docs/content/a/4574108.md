How can I identity whether the installed version of Java is 64 bit or 32 bit ?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4574108

You can get the os.arch property:
This will tell you the architecture of the OS, so not exactly the one of the VM.
Sun&#x27;s JREs have the following properties (values from my machine) that may be useful:
But have in mind that these will not work on VMs from other vendors. So you may want to find such properties of other VMs as well, so that you are not vendor-dependent.

```java
String osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch");
sun.arch.data.model : 32
sun.cpu.isalist : pentium_pro+mmx pentium_pro pentium+mmx pentium i486 i386 i86
