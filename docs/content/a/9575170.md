I can&#x27;t figure out why the following code doesn&#x27;t behave as expected
Do I need to escape forward slashes? I didn&#x27;t think so but I also tried the following against my will ... didn&#x27;t work
In the end I realized I don&#x27;t need a regular expression and I can just use the following, which doesn&#x27;t create a regular expression
However, I&#x27;d still like to understand why my first example doesn&#x27;t work.

"Hello/You/There".replaceAll("/", "\\/");
"Hello/You/There".replaceAll("\\/", "\\/");
"Hello/You/There".replace("/", "\\/");

The problem is actually that you need to double-escape backslashes in the replacement string. You see, &quot;\\/&quot; (as I&#x27;m sure you know) means the replacement string is \/, and (as you probably don&#x27;t know) the replacement string \/ actually just inserts /, because Java is weird, and gives \ a special meaning in the replacement string. (It&#x27;s supposedly so that \$ will be a literal dollar sign, but I think the real reason is that they wanted to mess with people. Other languages don&#x27;t do it this way.) So you have to write either:
or:
(Using java.util.regex.Matcher.quoteReplacement(String).)
