I&#x27;m implementing NxN puzzels in java 2D array int[][] state. am required to use the manhattan heureustic in the following way:
At the moment i don&#x27;t know how to go further. Am a beginner in puzzle game programming with 2D arrays so am sweating hard to understand certain concepts.
Am asking if someone can help by explaining to me the step by step the procedure i must follow to write this code in Java.
thank you

```java
the sum of the vertical and horizontal distances from 
                the current node to the goal node/tile

                                +(plus)

    the number of moves to reach the goal node from the initial position
```

This is more a math question, but anyways the Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute values of the horizontal and the vertical distance
More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int distance = Math.abs(x1-x0) + Math.abs(y1-y0);
```
