In our project we are migrating to java 8 and we are testing the new features of it.
On my project I&#x27;m using Guava predicates and functions to filter and transform some collections using Collections2.transform and Collections2.filter.
On this migration I need to change for example guava code to java 8 changes. So, the changes I&#x27;m doing are the kind of:
To...
Using guava I was very confortable debugging the code since I could debug each transformation process but my concern is how to debug for example .map(n -&gt; n*2).
Using the debugger I can see some code like:
But it isn&#x27;t as straighforward as Guava to debug the code, actually I couldn&#x27;t find the n * 2 transformation.
Is there a way to see this transformation or a way to easy debug this code?

## Original code snippet

I usually have no problem debugging lambda expressions while using Eclipse Kepler or Intellij IDEA (using JDK8u5). Just set a breakpoint and be sure not to inspect the whole lambda expression (inspect only the lambda body).

Another approach is to use peek to inspect the elements of the stream:
UPDATE:
I think you&#x27;re getting confused because map is an intermediate operation - in other words: it is a lazy operation which will be executed only after a terminal operation was executed. So when you call stream.map(n -&gt; n * 2) the lambda body isn&#x27;t being executed at the moment. You need to set a breakpoint and inspect it after a terminal operation was called (collect, in this case).
Check Stream Operations for further explanations.
UPDATE 2:
Quoting Holger&#x27;s comment:
What makes it tricky here is that the call to map and the lambda
  expression are in one line so a line breakpoint will stop on two
  completely unrelated actions.
Inserting a line break right after map(
  would allow you to set a break point for the lambda expression only.
  And it’s not unusual that debuggers don’t show intermediate values of
  a return statement. Changing the lambda to n -&gt; { int result=n * 2; return result; }
  would allow you to inspect result. Again, insert line
  breaks appropriately when stepping line by line…
