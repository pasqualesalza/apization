I&#x27;m trying to parse a webpage using Java with URLConnection. I try to set up the user-agent like this:
But the resulting user agent is the one I specify, with &quot;Java/1.5.0_19&quot; appended to the end. Is there a way to truly set the user agent without this addition?

```java
java.net.URLConnection c = url.openConnection();
c.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2");
```

Off hand, setting the http.agent system property to &quot;&quot; might do the trick (I don&#x27;t have the code in front of me).
You might get away with:
but that might require a race between you and initialisation of the URL protocol handler, if it caches the value at startup (actually, I don&#x27;t think it does).
The property can also be set through JNLP files (available to applets from 6u10) and on the command line:
Or for wrapper commands:

```java
System.setProperty("http.agent", "");
-Dhttp.agent=
-J-Dhttp.agent=
```
