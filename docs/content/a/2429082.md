So why use the this keyword? (I realise in some situations, it&#x27;s totally necessary to use it, I&#x27;m just asking for situations like this).

FALSE! It compiles but it doesn&#x27;t do what you think it does!
As to when to use it, a lot of it is personal preference. I like to use this in my public methods, even when it&#x27;s unnecessary, because that&#x27;s where the interfacing happens and it&#x27;s nice to assert what&#x27;s mine and what&#x27;s not.
