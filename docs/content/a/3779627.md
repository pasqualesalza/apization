So if I have a range of numbers &#x27;0 - 1024&#x27; and I want to bring them into &#x27;0 - 255&#x27;, the maths would dictate to divide the input by the maximum the input will be (1024 in this case) which will give me a number between 0.0 - 1.0. then multiply that by the destination range, (255).
Which is what I want to do!
But for some reason in Java (using Processing) It will always return a value of 0.

But I just get 0.0. I&#x27;ve tried double and int. all to no avail. WHY!?

```java
float scale;
scale = (n/1024) * 255;
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3779627

It&#x27;s because you&#x27;re doing integer division.
Divide by a double or a float, and it will work:
Or, if you want it as a float,

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
double scale = ( n / 1024.0 ) * 255 ;
float scale = ( n / 1024.0f ) * 255 ;
```
