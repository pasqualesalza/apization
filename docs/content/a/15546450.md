I have a Java application (JDK 1.7.0_13) and am using java.net.HttpURLConnection to connect to some servlet based services that do session management.  I am trying to figure out how to use java.net.CookieManager to track session cookies.  Reading the docs I get the impression that installing CookieManager with CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager()) should cause cookie management to happen automatically.  However, multiple requests to the same URL&#x27;s does not seem to preserve cookies.  Do I have to manually extract cookies from responses and resend them in requests on my own or is CookieManager going to do this for me automatically?  If CookieManager doesn&#x27;t, then what value does it add?
