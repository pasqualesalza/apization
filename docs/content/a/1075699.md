What is the simplest way to find if two Lists contain exactly the same elements, in the standard Java libraries?
It shouldn&#x27;t matter if the two Lists are the same instance or not, and it shouldn&#x27;t matter if the type parameter of the Lists are different.
e.g.
There&#x27;s probably something staring me in the face I know :-)
EDIT: To clarify, I was looking for the EXACT same elements and number of elements, in order.

```java
List list1
List<String> list2; 
// ... construct etc

list1.add("A");
list2.add("A"); 
// the function, given these two lists, should return true
```


## Original code snippet

If you care about order, then just use the equals method:
From the javadoc:
Compares the specified object with
  this list for equality. Returns true
  if and only if the specified object is
  also a list, both lists have the same
  size, and all corresponding pairs of
  elements in the two lists are equal.
  (Two elements e1 and e2 are equal if
  (e1==null ? e2==null :
  e1.equals(e2)).) In other words, two
  lists are defined to be equal if they
  contain the same elements in the same
  order. This definition ensures that
  the equals method works properly
  across different implementations of
  the List interface.
If you want to check independent of order, you could copy all of the elements to Sets and use equals on the resulting Sets:
A limitation of this approach is that it not only ignores order, but also frequency of duplicate elements. For example, if list1 was [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;] and list2 was [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] the Set approach would consider them to be equal.
If you need to be insensitive to order but sensitive to the frequency of duplicates you can either:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
list1.equals(list2)
public static <T> boolean listEqualsIgnoreOrder(List<T> list1, List<T> list2) {
    return new HashSet<>(list1).equals(new HashSet<>(list2));
}
```
