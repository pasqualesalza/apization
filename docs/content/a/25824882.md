How to get value of selected radioButton?
I tried using buttonGroup1.getSelection().getActionCommand() (as posted in some of answers here) but it is not working.
Also, i am temporarily using this code but i want to know is this a good practice or not?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
//Consider that maleRButton and femaleRButton are two radioButtons of 
//same buttonGroup
String getGender()
{
    if(maleRButton.isSelected())
    {
        return "Male";
    }
    else if(femaleRButton.isSelected())
    {
        return "Female";
    }
    else
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

I tried using buttonGroup1.getSelection().getActionCommand()
That approach will work, but for some reason it looks like you manually need to set the action command when you create the button. For example:
This acutally seems like a bit of a bug to me since usually the action command defaults to the text if the action command is not set.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
JRadioButton maleButton = new JRadioButton( "Male" );
maleButton.setActionCommand( maleButton.getText() );
```
