Given a string that isn&#x27;t too long, what is the best way to read it line by line?
I know you can do:
Another way would be to take the substring on the eol:
Any other maybe simpler ways of doing it?  I have no problems with the above approaches, just interested to know if any of you know something that may look simpler and more efficient?

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new StringReader(<string>));
reader.readLine();
final String eol = System.getProperty("line.separator");
output = output.substring(output.indexOf(eol + 1));
```


## Original code snippet

You can also use the split method of String:
This gives you all lines in a handy array.
I don&#x27;t know about the performance of split. It uses regular expressions.

```java
String[] lines = myString.split(System.getProperty("line.separator"));
```
