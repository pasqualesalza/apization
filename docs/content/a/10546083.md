I have to print the EST time in my Java application. I had set the time zone to EST using:
But when the daylight savings is being followed in this timezone, my code does not print the correct time (it prints 1 hour less).
How to make the code work to read the correct time always, irrespective of whether the daylight savings are being observed or not?
PS: I tried setting the timezone to EDT, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem.

```java

```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/10546083

This is the problem to start with:
The 3-letter abbreviations should be wholeheartedly avoided in favour of TZDB zone IDs. EST is Eastern Standard Time - and Standard time never observes DST; it&#x27;s not really a full time zone name. It&#x27;s the name used for part of a time zone. (Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t come across a good term for this &quot;half time zone&quot; concept.)
You want a full time zone name. For example, America/New_York is in the Eastern time zone:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone("EST"));
TimeZone zone = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/New_York");
DateFormat format = DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance();
format.setTimeZone(zone);

System.out.println(format.format(new Date()));
```
