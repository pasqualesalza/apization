Im working in a project and I got two types in Date. I want to calculate the number of weeks between these two dates. The dates can be in diffrent years. Is there any good solution for this?
I have tried to implemenent this with Joda-time which was suggested in other topics..

But this is completely wrong... any suggestions ?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static int getNumberOfWeeks(Date f, Date l){
    Calendar c1 = Calendar.getInstance();
    Calendar c2 = Calendar.getInstance();
    c1.setTime(f);
    c2.setTime(l);
    DateTime start = new DateTime(c1.YEAR, c1.MONTH, c1.DAY_OF_MONTH, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    DateTime end   = new DateTime(c2.YEAR, c2.MONTH, c2.DAY_OF_MONTH, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    Interval interval = new Interval(start, end);
    Period p = interval.toPeriod();
    return p.getWeeks();
}
```

It is pretty easy with joda time:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
DateTime dateTime1 = new DateTime(date1);
DateTime dateTime2 = new DateTime(date2);

int weeks = Weeks.weeksBetween(dateTime1, dateTime2).getWeeks();
```
