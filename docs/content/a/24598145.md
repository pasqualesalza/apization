In my Spring application, I have a simple properties file located in folder WEB-INF\classes so that it, the DispatcherServlet and various other config files are in the classpath.
The props file is defined in the DispatcherServlet as:
The propertiesFactory bean is injected into a controller:
And used in a one of the controller&#x27;s methods as:
This all works perfectly, except for a test program as follows which has line:
Which throws a BeanCreationException:
Because of:
But if the whole application can see the props file, why not this one program?

Everything in WEB-INF/classes is added to the root of the classpath. As such, you need to refer to your resource simply as
or better yet
in
You may find it useful to run
and see what was used as classpath entries.

classpath:library.properties
<property name="location">
