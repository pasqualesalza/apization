Java has a logical AND operator.
Java has a logical OR operator.
Java has a logical NOT operator.
Java has no logical XOR operator, according to sun.  I would like to define one.
As a method it is simply defined as follows:

This method is called in the following way:

I would much rather have an operator, used as follows:

I can&#x27;t find anything on how to go about defining a new operator in Java.  Where should I start?

```java
public static boolean logicalXOR(boolean x, boolean y) {
    return ( ( x || y ) && ! ( x && y ) );
}
boolean myVal = logicalXOR(x, y);
boolean myVal = x ^^ y;
```


## Original code snippet

Java does have a logical XOR operator, it is ^ (as in a ^ b).
Apart from that, you can&#x27;t define new operators in Java.
Edit: Here&#x27;s an example:
Output:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean[] all = { false, true };
    for (boolean a : all) {
        for (boolean b: all) {
            boolean c = a ^ b;
            System.out.println(a + " ^ " + b + " = " + c);
        }
    }
}
```
