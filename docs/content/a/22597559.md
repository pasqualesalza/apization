I have to write a program that counts the uniques characters in a String given by the user. For example &quot;abc&quot; returns 3 and &quot;aabbccd&quot; returns 4. I am not allow to use  advanced Java classes like Map, Set, etc. I can only use arrays, Strings, for loops, while loops, if statements. I am trying to use a nested loop but am getting confused about how to write the algorithm for the second for loop.

```java
public static int countUniqueCharacters(String input){

String orgInput = input.toLowerCase();
        int count = 0;
        int stringLength = input.length();
        for( int i = 0; i<stringLength; i++){
            for(int j = 2; j > j-i-1; j--){
                char temp = orgInput.charAt(i);
                if (temp == orgInput.charAt(j)){
                    count++;

## Original code snippet

It is extremely easy :)
Example for input &quot;aab&quot;
First for-cycle goes 3 times, each time for one char.
Value of &quot;a&quot; is 97, so it turns isItThere[97] to true, then second &quot;a&quot; is involved, which is doing the same, isItThere[97] is set to true again (hence changing nothing).
After that &quot;b&quot; is involved, value of char &quot;b&quot; is 98, therefore isItThere[98] is set to true.
And then you have second for-cycle, where you cycle through the all isItThere array. If you find any true statement, you increment count. In our case, you find isItThere[97] and isItThere[98] as true statement, it means you increment twice and returning 2.

```java
public static int countUniqueCharacters(String input) {
    boolean[] isItThere = new boolean[Character.MAX_VALUE];
    for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
        isItThere[input.charAt(i)] = true;
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < isItThere.length; i++) {
        if (isItThere[i] == true){
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
