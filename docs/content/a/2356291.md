I have a text file which contains data seperated by &#x27;|&#x27;. I need to get each field(seperated by &#x27;|&#x27;) and process it. The text file can be shown as below :
ABC|DEF||FGHT
I am using string tokenizer(JDK 1.4) for getting each field value. Now the problem is, I should get an empty string after DEF.However, I am not getting the empty space between DEF &amp; FGHT.
My result should be - ABC,DEF,&quot;&quot;,FGHT but I am getting ABC,DEF,FGHT



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2356291

From StringTokenizer documentation :
StringTokenizer is a legacy class that
  is retained for compatibility reasons
  although its use is discouraged in new
  code. It is recommended that anyone
  seeking this functionality use the
  split  method of String or the
  java.util.regex package instead.
The following code should work :

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "ABC|DEF||FGHT";
String[] r = s.split("\\|");
```
