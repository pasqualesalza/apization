I am developing a Java EE application in which I need Base64 Encoding/Decoding
So I added commons-codec-1.5.jar in WEB-INF/lib folder of my application and used
in the Java file.
During compile time, when I type Base64, it shows encodeBase64String method is available. But during runtime it is throwing an exception like this:
I have the JAR in the buildpath, but still I don&#x27;t understand why it throws me the above error.

## Original code snippet

That method was introduced in Commons Codec 1.4. This exception indicates that you&#x27;ve an older version of Commons Codec somewhere else in the webapp&#x27;s runtime classpath which got precedence in classloading. Check all paths covered by the webapp&#x27;s runtime classpath. This includes among others the Webapp/WEB-INF/lib, YourAppServer/lib, JRE/lib and JRE/lib/ext. Finally remove or upgrade the offending older version.
Update: as per the comments, you can&#x27;t seem to locate it. I can only suggest to outcomment the code using that newer method and then put the following line in place:
That should print the absolute path to the JAR file where it was been loaded from during runtime.
Update 2: this did seem to point to the right file. Sorry, I can&#x27;t explain your problem anymore right now. All I can suggest is to use a different Base64 method like encodeBase64(byte[]) and then just construct a new String(bytes) yourself.
