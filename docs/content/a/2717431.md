What regular expression using java could be used to filter out dashes &#x27;-&#x27; and open close round brackets from a string representing phone numbers...
so that (234) 887-9999 should give 2348879999
and similarly 234-887-9999 should give 2348879999.
Thanks,



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2717431

The regular expression defines a character class consisting of any whitespace character (\s, which is escaped as \\s because we&#x27;re passing in a String), a dash (escaped because a dash means something special in the context of character classes), and parentheses.
See String.replaceAll(String, String).
EDIT
Per gunslinger47:
Replaces any non-digit with an empty string.
