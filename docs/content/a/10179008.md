I have an array of Strings that represent Binary numbers (without leading zeroes) that I want to convert to their corresponding base 10 numbers. Consider:
What&#x27;s the best way to proceed? I&#x27;ve been exploring java.lang.number.* without finding a direct conversion method. Integer.parseInt(b) yields an integer EQUAL to the String...e.g., 1001 becomes 1,001 instead of 9...and does not seem to include a parameter for an output base. toBinaryString does the conversion the wrong direction. I suspect I&#x27;ll need to do a multistep conversion, but can&#x27;t seem to find the right combination of methods or subclasses. I&#x27;m also not sure the extent to which leading zeros or lack thereof will be an issue. Anyone have any good directions to point me?

```java
binary 1011 becomes integer 11
binary 1001 becomes integer 9
binary   11 becomes integer 3   etc.
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/10179008

You need to specify the radix. There&#x27;s an overload of Integer#parseInt() which allows you to.

```java
int foo = Integer.parseInt("1001", 2);
```
