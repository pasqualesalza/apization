I have recently checked on my Java version. I ran the command java -version and I found out that I was using java version 1.7.0_09. But when I tried to check on C:\Program Files\Java\ directory, I don&#x27;t seem to find the same version. I only see the following:
And so on...
My programs still run, but I&#x27;m just trying to compile everything manually, and understand how Java is being treated by the OS.
Another thing that is weird is, I tried to check on environment variable settings, and it does not say anything about jdk1.7.0_09.
Path:

The complete directory is C:\Users\User02\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\jre1.7.0_09 and it&#x27;s just got the file named lzma.dll.
But, I have another directory that says C:\Users\User02\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\jdk1.7.0_07. The files inside it are:

It&#x27;s possible to have many JRE side-by-side on a computer.
If the JRE is properly installed on Windows, informations about each version are stored in the registry. The installation process installs a special java.exe in the system PATH (%SYSTEMROOT%\System32). So you don&#x27;t need to alter you PATH because this special java.exe will find the current JRE. From a command line, type java -version to display the current jre version installed.
With release 1.6, it&#x27;s now possible to select a different JRE installation than the last one without any registry modification.
The JRE installation are listed in the registry in the key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment
Take this simple test class
On a system, with 1.6 and 1.5 installed. If you type
It&#x27;s probably the 1.6 JRE that will be used since it&#x27;s the last installed.
To force the 1.5 JRE instead, use this command line.
If the bytecode is incompatible with the given JRE then .. it won&#x27;t work, of course.
ref :  technote java 6
You can always give the complete path to use a specific installation. Launching the JVM this way does not use the registry setting at all.
