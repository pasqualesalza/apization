The following code throws NullPointerException:
Is my compiler invoking getInteger on null since it&#x27;s static? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense!
What&#x27;s happening?

```java
int num = Integer.getInteger("123");
```


## Original code snippet

There are two issues at play here:
To parse (String) &quot;123&quot; to (int) 123, you can use e.g. int Integer.parseInt(String).
Here&#x27;s what the documentation have to say about what this method does:
public static Integer getInteger(String nm): Determines the integer value of the system property with the specified name.  If there is no property with the specified name, if the specified name is empty or null, or if the property does not have the correct numeric format, then null is returned.
In other words, this method has nothing to do with parsing a String to an int/Integer value, but rather, it has to do with System.getProperty method.
