I&#x27;m developing a program that would require huge amount of memory, and I want to catch when out-of-memory exception happens. I had heard this is not possible to do, but curious if there is any development on this end.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1692243

It&#x27;s not an exception; it&#x27;s an error: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
You can catch it as it descends from Throwable:
However, unless you&#x27;re doing some rather specific stuff (allocating tons of things within a specific code section, for example) you likely won&#x27;t be able to catch it as you won&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to be thrown from.

```java
try {
    // create lots of objects here and stash them somewhere
} catch (OutOfMemoryError E) {
    // release some (all) of the above objects
}
```
