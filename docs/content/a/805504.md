This should be really simple. If I have a String like this:
then what is a generally-accepted way to get a list of files that match this pattern? (e.g. it should match ../Test1/sample22b.txt and ../Test4/sample-spiffy.txt but not ../Test3/sample2.blah or ../Test44/sample2.txt)

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/805504

Consider DirectoryScanner from Apache Ant:
You&#x27;ll need to reference ant.jar (~ 1.3 MB for ant 1.7.1).

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
DirectoryScanner scanner = new DirectoryScanner();
scanner.setIncludes(new String[]{"**/*.java"});
scanner.setBasedir("C:/Temp");
scanner.setCaseSensitive(false);
scanner.scan();
String[] files = scanner.getIncludedFiles();
```
