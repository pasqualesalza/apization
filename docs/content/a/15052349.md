I am attempting to output information regarding students stored by my program in a tabular-like format as \t does not always provide the correct spacing. In order to do so, I came across this question and have attempted to enable a similar solution. However, I am obtaining errors with the format lines in my code when I attempt to execute it as such.
The goal of the code is to output in a manner similar to the following image.
Please aid me in finding my error. Is there perhaps an alternatively method to perform this?
Thanks.
EDIT: The error(s) I am getting are
It should be noted that Grade is an integer and Long is a double.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15052349

The error is because%d is for numeric non-floating point values (int, long, etc).
In the line where you print the titles, you have to use %XXs (where XX is a number) since you&#x27;re passing Strings as parameters:
In the line inside the while-loop, you need to set %d for the int and long variables, like Grade and Student Number, there&#x27;s no need to convert it to String using &quot;&quot; + intProperty:
Since it looks like you want to format the output to the left (and not to the right), you should add a hypen (-) symbol before the XX number:
Note: I assumed read.getClass() and read.getStudentNum() would return the Grade and Student number values as int or long.

System.out.format ("%10d%15s%15s%15d%20s",
    read.getClass(), read.getLastName(), read.getFirstName(),
    read.getStudentNum(), read.getParentEmail());
