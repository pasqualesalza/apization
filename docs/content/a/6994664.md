I want to copy the content of file &#x27;A&#x27; to file &#x27;B&#x27;.
after the copying is done I want to clear the content of file &#x27;A&#x27; and want to write on it from its beginning.
I can&#x27;t delete file &#x27;A&#x27; as it is related to some other task.
I was able to copy the content using java&#x27;s file API(readLine() ), but don&#x27;t know how to clear the content of file and set the file pointer to the beginning of the file.



## Original code snippet

Just print an empty string into the file:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(file);
writer.print("");
writer.close();
```
