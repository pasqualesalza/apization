I&#x27;m familiar with the ways I can get an element position in array, especially the ones showed here: Element position in array
But my problem is I can&#x27;t figure out how to convert this code to fit my needs.
What I want to check is if a String has a match in an ArrayList and if so, what&#x27;s the index of the String in the ArrayList.
The annoying part is I managed to verify the String is in the ArrayList (see first line of my code)
listPackages is the ArrayList
current_package is the String I want to find its position in listPackages.
Here&#x27;s my code:
Would appreciate any help!
Thanks!


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if (listPackages.contains(current_package)) {

        int position = -1;
        for(int j = 0; j < listPackages.size(); j++) {

            if(listPackages[j] == current_package) {
              position = j;
                  break;
              }
            }
    }
```


## Original code snippet

Use indexOf:
Note that you shouldn&#x27;t generally use == to compare strings - that will compare references, i.e. whether the two values are references to the same object, rather than to equal strings. Instead, you should call equals(). That&#x27;s probably what was going wrong with your existing code, but obviously using indexOf is a lot simpler.

```java
int index = listPackages.indexOf(current_package);
```
