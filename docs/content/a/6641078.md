question_text: "I'm new to Java and am trying to understand why the first code snippet doesn't cause this exception but the second one does.

answer_text: "For me (using Java 1.6.0_26), the first snippet gives the same exception as the second one. The reason is that the Arrays.asList(..) method does only return a List, not necessarily an ArrayList. Because you don't really know what kind (or implementation of) of List that method returns, your cast to ArrayList<String> is not safe. The result is that it may or may not work as expected. From a coding style perspective, a good fix for this would be to change your stuff declaration to: which will allow to add whatever comes out of the Arrays.asList(..) method."

I&#x27;m new to Java and am trying to understand why the first code snippet doesn&#x27;t cause this exception but the second one does.  Since a string array is passed into Arrays.asList in both cases, shouldn&#x27;t both snippets produce an exception or not produce an exception?
First snippet (causes no exception):
Second snippet (causes above exception):
If relevant, I&#x27;m using JavaSE 1.6 in Eclipse Helios.

## Original code snippet

For me (using Java 1.6.0_26), the first snippet gives the same exception as the second one. The reason is that the Arrays.asList(..) method does only return a List, not necessarily an ArrayList. Because you don&#x27;t really know what kind (or implementation of) of List that method returns, your cast to ArrayList&lt;String&gt; is not safe. The result is that it may or may not work as expected. From a coding style perspective, a good fix for this would be to change your stuff declaration to:
which will allow to add whatever comes out of the Arrays.asList(..) method.
