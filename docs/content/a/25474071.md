I want to get the current hour,minute, and second from the Date object.
This is my code:
But I get a kind of error, the getHours() part doesnt work. I get a &quot;The method getHours() from the type Data is deprecated&quot;. What does that mean, and how do I get the hour,minutes, and seconds?

int hour = date.getHours();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/25474071

Use Calendar:
From Date javadoc:
Deprecated. As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE).
Returns the number of minutes past the hour represented by this date, as interpreted in the local time zone. The value returned is between 0 and 59.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.setTime(date);  
int hours = cal.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
```
