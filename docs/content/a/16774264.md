I am new in Java although had a good experience in PHP, and looking for perfect replacement for explode and implode (available in PHP) functions in Java.
I have Googled for the same but not satisfied with the results.
Anyone has the good solution for my problem will be appreciated.
For example:
Desired output:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "x,y,z";
array a = javaExplode(',',s);  //what is javaExplode??
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
[x, y, z]
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16774264

The Javadoc for String reveals that String.split() is what you&#x27;re looking for in regard to explode.
Java does not include a &quot;implode&quot; of &quot;join&quot; equivalent. Rather than including a giant external dependency for a simple function as the other answers suggest, you may just want to write a couple lines of code. There&#x27;s a number of ways to accomplish that; using a StringBuilder is one:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String foo = "This,that,other";
String[] split = foo.split(",");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < split.length; i++) {
    sb.append(split[i]);
    if (i != split.length - 1) {
        sb.append(" ");
    }
}
String joined = sb.toString();
```
