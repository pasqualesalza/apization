I have some tests like this:
What I need while running tests is to print each assert message to stdout and then result of the assert.
This is require format from test class:
But how to do that? I&#x27;m quite a new working with JUnit and have no idea. Is there way using runners and suites? Or exist any assertSuccess(), assertFailed() methods? Thanks for any hint.

```java
@Test
public void test01()
{
    Position p = getPositionAt('a', 1);
    assertNotNull("a1 exists", p);
    assertNotNull("figure exists a1", p.getFigure());

    p = getPositionAt('a', 2);
    assertNotNull("exists a2", p);
    assertNull("figure exists a2", p.getFigure());

    p = getPositionAt('b', 1);
    assertNotNull("exists b1", p);
    assertNull("figure exists b1", p.getFigure());
}
a1 exists -success
figure exists a1 -success
exists a2 -success
figure exists a2 -succcess
exists b1 -succcess
figure exists b1 -failed
```

First, you have two issues not one. When an assertion fails, an AssertionError exception is thrown. This prevents any assertion past this point from being checked. To address this you need to use an ErrorCollector.
Second, I do not believe there is any way built in to JUnit to do this. However, you could implement your own methods that wrap the assertions:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void assertNotNull(String description, Object object){
     try{
          assertNotNull(description, object);
          System.out.println(description + " - passed");
     }catch(AssertionError e){
          System.out.println(description + " - failed");

        throw e;
     }
}
```
