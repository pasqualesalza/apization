StringTokenizer? Convert the String to a char[] and iterate over that? Something else?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/196834

I use a for loop to iterate the string and use charAt() to get each character to examine it.  Since the String is implemented with an array, the charAt() method is a constant time operation.
That&#x27;s what I would do.  It seems the easiest to me.
As far as correctness goes, I don&#x27;t believe that exists here.  It is all based on your personal style.

```java
String s = "...stuff...";

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
    char c = s.charAt(i);        
    //Process char
}
```
