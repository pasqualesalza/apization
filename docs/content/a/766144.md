This has probably been asked before, but a quick search only brought up the same question asked for C#. See here.
What I basically want to do is to check wether a given object implements a given interface.
I kind of figured out a solution but this is just not comfortable enough to use it frequently in if or case statements and I was wondering wether Java does not have built-in solution.
EDIT: Ok, thanks for your answers. Especially to Damien Pollet and Noldorin, you made me rethink my design so I don&#x27;t test for interfaces anymore.

```java
public static Boolean implementsInterface(Object object, Class interf){
    for (Class c : object.getClass().getInterfaces()) {
        if (c.equals(interf)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/766144

The instanceof operator does the work in a NullPointerException safe way. For example:
yields true. Since:
yields false, the instanceof operator is null safe (the code you posted isn&#x27;t).
instanceof is the built-in, compile-time safe alternative to Class#isInstance(Object)

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if ("" instanceof java.io.Serializable) {
     // it's true
 }
if (null instanceof AnyType) {
     // never reached
 }
```
