I need my Java program to take a string like:
and turn it into a string array like:
No periods, or punctuation (preferably). By the way, the string input is always one sentence.
Is there an easy way to do this that I&#x27;m not seeing? Or do we really have to search for spaces a lot and create new strings from the areas between the spaces (which are words)?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
"This is a sample sentence."
{"this","is","a","sample","sentence"}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4674887

String.split() will do most of what you want. You may then need to loop over the words to pull out any punctuation.
For example:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "This is a sample sentence.";
String[] words = s.split("\\s+");
for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    // You may want to check for a non-word character before blindly
    // performing a replacement
    // It may also be necessary to adjust the character class
    words[i] = words[i].replaceAll("[^\\w]", "");
}
```
