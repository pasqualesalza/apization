I am working on a project that uses Java Swing. The default look and feel of the Java Swing GUI is very boring. Is there any way I can use a better look and feel? Something like on web pages...



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2592258

You can set the look and feel to reflect the platform:
If this is not nice enough for you, take a look at SWT for Eclipse.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
try { 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
