I have been trying to figure out how to extract a portion of a string between two special characters &#x27; and &quot; I&#x27;ve been looking into regex, but frankly I cannot understand it.
Example in Java code:
I would like to pull out 89
In general I would just like to know how to extract part of a string between two specific characters please.
Also it would be nice to know how to extract part of the string from the beginning to a specific character like to get 21.

Try this regular expression:
As a Java string literal you will have to write it as follows:
Here is a more complete example demonstrating how to use this regular expression with a Matcher:
See it working online: ideone

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
'(.*?)"
"'(.*?)\""
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'(.*?)\"");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(str);
if (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println(matcher.group(1));
}
```
