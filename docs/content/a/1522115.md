I am looking to find the index of a given element, knowing its contents, in Java.
I tried the following example, which does not work:
Can anyone please explain what is wrong with this and what I need to do to fix it?

```java
class masi { 
    public static void main( String[] args ) { 
        char[] list = {'m', 'e', 'y'};

        // should print 1
        System.out.println(list[] == "e");                    
    } 
}
```


## Original code snippet

In this case, you could create e new String from your array of chars and then do an indeoxOf(&quot;e&quot;) on that String:
But in other cases of primitive data types, you&#x27;ll have to iterate over it.

```java
System.out.println(new String(list).indexOf("e"));
```
