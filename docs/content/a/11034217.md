I don&#x27;t want to do it the formal way by using a for loop that goes over all the elements of the string a &quot;particular no. of times&quot;(length of string) .
Is there any character that is always at the end of every string in Java just like it it in c ?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/11034217

You have two basic options:
The first loops through a character array, the second loops using a normal indexed loop.
Java does however, support characters like &#x27;\n&#x27; (new line). If you want to check for the presence of this character, you can use the indexOf(&#x27;\n&#x27;) method that will return the position of the character, or -1 if it could not be found.  Be warned that &#x27;\n&#x27; characters are not required to be able to end a string, so you can&#x27;t rely on that alone.
Strings in Java do NOT have a NULL terminator as in C, so you need to use the length() method to find out how long a string is.

```java
String myString = "ABCD";
for (char c : myString.toCharArray())
{
  System.out.println("Characer is " + c);
}

for (int i = 0; i < myString.length(); i++)
{
  System.out.println("Character is " + myString.charAt(i));
}
