I have developed a telecommunication application for locating signal strengths from the towers. I have used java swing and I&#x27;m having a problem when drawing the circle around the given point of the mobile signal transmitter tower location. I have already calculated the X, Y coordinates and also the radius value.
Please find the below code which I&#x27;ve used to draw the circle and it is having issues.
The issue is, it creates the circle but it didn&#x27;t take the X and Y coordinates as the center point. It took the X and Y coordinates as the top left point of the circle.
Could anyone please help me to draw the circle by having the given X and Y coordinates as the center point of the circle.

## Original code snippet

The fillOval fits an oval inside a rectangle, with width=r, height = r you get a circle.
If you want fillOval(x,y,r,r) to draw a circle with the center at (x,y) you will have to displace the rectangle by half its width and half its height.
This will draw a circle with center at x,y

```java
public void drawCenteredCircle(Graphics2D g, int x, int y, int r) {
  x = x-(r/2);
  y = y-(r/2);
  g.fillOval(x,y,r,r);
}
```
