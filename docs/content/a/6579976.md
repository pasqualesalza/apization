But i need to use it as is, like [A-Za-z0-9.,-:]*
I&#x27;ve tried to escape it, but this doesn&#x27;t work [A-Za-z0-9.,-\:]*



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/6579976

In most regex implementations (including Java&#x27;s), : has no special meaning, neither inside nor outside a character class.
Your problem is most likely due to the fact the - acts as a range operator in your class:
where ,-: matches all ascii characters between &#x27;,&#x27; and &#x27;:&#x27;. Note that it still matches the literal &#x27;:&#x27; however!
Try this instead:
By placing - at the start or the end of the class, it matches the literal &quot;-&quot;. As mentioned in the comments by Keoki Zee, you can also escape the - inside the class, but most people simply add it at the end.
A demo:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
[A-Za-z0-9.,-:]*
[A-Za-z0-9.,:-]*
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("8:".matches("[,-:]+"));      // true: '8' is in the range ','..':'
        System.out.println("8:".matches("[,:-]+"));      // false: '8' does not match ',' or ':' or '-'
        System.out.println(",,-,:,:".matches("[,:-]+")); // true: all chars match ',' or ':' or '-'
    }
}
```
