GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar();
gc.YEAR // returning 1       
gc.MONTH // returning 2

Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.YEAR // returning 1

```

Just to give a bit more background:
Both new GregorianCalendar() and Calendar.getInstance() will correctly give a calendar initialized at the current date and time.
MONTH and YEAR are constants within the Calendar class. You should not use them &quot;via&quot; a reference which makes it look like they&#x27;re part of the state of an object. It&#x27;s an unfortunate part of the design of the Calendar class that to access the values of different fields, you need to call get with a field number, specified as one of those constants, as shown in other answers:
Note that the month numbers are 0-based, so at the time of this writing (in April) the month number will be 3.
It&#x27;s an unfortunate part of the design of the Java language that you can reference static members (such as constants) via expressions of that type, rather than only through the type name.
My recommendations:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
int year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
int month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH);
```
