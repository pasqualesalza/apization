I seem to have the reverse problem to most people.  I have the following pretty standard code to see if the user wants to do some saves before closing the window:
No matter what I try, the window always closes when I come out of windowClosing.  Changing WindowAdapter to WindowListener doesn&#x27;t make any difference.  What is weird is that the documentation explicitly says &quot;If the program does not explicitly hide or dispose the window while processing this event, the window close operation will be cancelled,&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t work that way for me. Is there some other way of handling the x on the frame?  TIA


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);
  frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
     public void windowClosing(WindowEvent ev) {
      boolean close = true;
         // check some files, asking if the user wants to save
         // YES and NO handle OK, but if the user hits Cancel on any file,
         //   I want to abort the close process     
         // So if any of them hit Cancel, I set "close" to false
      if (close) {
          frame.dispose();
          System.exit(0);
         }
       }            
});
```


## Original code snippet

I&#x27;ve just tried this minimal test case:
If I keep the dispose call commented, and hit the close button, the window doesn&#x27;t exit. Uncomment that and hit the close button, window closes.
I&#x27;d have to guess that something is wrong in your logic to set your &quot;close&quot; variable. Try double checking that.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;

import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.WindowConstants;

public class test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final JFrame frame = new JFrame("Test");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent ev) {
                //frame.dispose();
            }
        });
        frame.setVisible(true);

    }

}
```
