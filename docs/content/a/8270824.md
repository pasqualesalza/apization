I&#x27;m trying to work out a way of splitting up a string in java that follows a pattern like so:
The results from this should be the following:
However I&#x27;m completely stumped as to how I can achieve this. Please can someone help me out? I have tried searching online for a similar problem, however it&#x27;s very difficult to phrase it correctly in a search.
Please note: The number of letters &amp; numbers may vary (e.g. There could be a string like so &#x27;1234a5bcdef&#x27;)

```java
String a = "123abc345def";
x[0] = "123";
x[1] = "abc";
x[2] = "345";
x[3] = "def";
```


## Original code snippet

You could try to split on (?&lt;=\D)(?=\d)|(?&lt;=\d)(?=\D), like:
It matches positions between a number and not-a-number (in any order).

```java
str.split("(?<=\\D)(?=\\d)|(?<=\\d)(?=\\D)");
