In my Java application I have been passed in a string that looks like this:
&quot;\u00a5123&quot;
When printing that string into the console, I get the same string as the output (as expected).
However, I want to print that out by having the unicode converted into the actual yen symbol (\u00a5 -&gt; yen symbol) - how would I go about doing this?
i.e. so it looks like this: &quot;[yen symbol]123&quot;



## Original code snippet

I wrote a little program:
It&#x27;s output:
¥123
i.e. it output exactly what you stated in your post.  I am not sure there is not something else going on.   What version of Java are you using?
