I am really new to java (started learning 2 days ago). Sorry if this is a stupid question. I am trying to learn how to use rt.exec &amp; similar methods so I tried to make a very simple program which runs calc.exe. This is the code:

I get the error &quot; The value of local variable p is not used&quot;.
And if I try to compile this is what I get:

I think it&#x27;s easy to fix but I don&#x27;t know how. Would be nice if someone helped.

Well, the error &quot;The value of local variable p is not used.&quot;, Is not actually an error. It&#x27;s your IDE (Eclipse), warning you that you aren&#x27;t actually reading that variable, so you aren&#x27;t receiving any input from it.
And the other problem with your class is, you don&#x27;t have a main method. Like this,
And by the way, you should always start a class name with a captial letter. So public class main, should actually be public class Main

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime() ;
Process p = rt.exec("calc.exe") ;
} catch(Exception exc){
/*handle exception*/
}
    }
}
