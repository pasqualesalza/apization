I know this is probably very stupid, but a lot of places claim that the Integer class in Java is immutable, yet the following code:
Executes without any trouble giving the (expected) result 6. So effectively the value of a has changed. Doesn&#x27;t that mean Integer is mutable?
Secondary question and a little offtopic: &quot;Immutable classes do not need copy constructors&quot;. Anyone care to explain why?

Immutable does not mean that a can never equal another value. For example, String is immutable too, but I can still do this:
So what happened there? Since String is immutable, clearly str was not changed. But it now equals something different. This is because str is now a completely newly instantiated object, just as your Integer is. So the value of a did not mutate, but it was replaced with a completely new object, i.e. new Integer(6).

```java
String str = "hello";
// str equals "hello"
str = str + "world";
// now str equals "helloworld"
```
