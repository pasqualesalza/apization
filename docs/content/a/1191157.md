My Java application runs another Java application, by running the process &quot;java -jar j.jar&quot;. J.jar is known to use a LOT of memory depending on the dataset it is given, and often gets an OutOfMemoryError heap. So I want to use -Xmx on it, so that I can allocate as much memory as possible (or close to). I was thinking of getting the total memory on the system, then specifying 80-90% of that in -Xmx.
Is there any solution to my problem? And, how does my solution sound?
Edit: I cant reduce the memory consumption as the memory being used is by Java&#x27;s built-in pack200 compression, which I am using to pack some JAR files.

Depending on your OS, this might work for getting the free and available memory size:
From there, you can figure out 80-90% and launch your jar with the max memory size you want.
I don&#x27;t know that this works with all OS&#x27;s (i.e. Windows), but it worked when I tested it with both OSX and Linux.

long freeMemory = sunmxbean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize();
long availableMemory = sunmxbean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize();
