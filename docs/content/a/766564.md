I&#x27;m afraid of varargs. I don&#x27;t know what to use them for.
Plus, it feels dangerous to let people pass as many arguments as they want.
What&#x27;s an example of a context that would be a good place to use them?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/766564

Varargs are useful for any method that needs to deal with an indeterminate number of objects.  One good example is String.format.  The format string can accept any number of parameters, so you need a mechanism to pass in any number of objects.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String.format("This is an integer: %d", myInt);
String.format("This is an integer: %d and a string: %s", myInt, myString);
```
