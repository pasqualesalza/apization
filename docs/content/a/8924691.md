Write a method called wordCount that accepts a String as its parameter and returns the number of words in the String. A word is a sequence of one or more nonspace characters (any character other than &#x27; &#x27;). For example, the call wordCount(&quot;hello&quot;) should return 1, the call wordCount(&quot;how are you?&quot;) should return 3, the call wordCount(&quot; this string has wide spaces &quot;) should return 5, and the call wordCount(&quot; &quot;) should return 0.
I made a function:
But i know this has 1 limitation that it will also count the number of spaces after all the words in the string have finished nad it will also count 2 blank spaces as possibly being 2 words :(
Is there a predefined function for word count? or can this code be corrected?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static int wordCount(String s){

  int counter = 0;

  for(int i=0; i<=s.length()-1; i++) {

    if(Character.isLetter(s.charAt(i))){

      counter++;

      for(i<=s.length()-1; i++){

        if(s.charAt(i)==' '){

          counter++;
        }
      }                
    }
  }

  return counter;
}
```


## Original code snippet

If you want to ignore leading, trailing and duplicate spaces you can use

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String trimmed = text.trim();
int words = trimmed.isEmpty() ? 0 : trimmed.split("\\s+").length;
```
