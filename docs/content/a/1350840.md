How can you realize the usage of JNDI , with an example if possible?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1350840

JNDI is the Java Naming and Directory Interface.  It&#x27;s used to separate the concerns of the application developer and the application deployer. When you&#x27;re writing an application which relies on a database, you shouldn&#x27;t need to worry about the user name or password for connecting to that database. JNDI allows the developer to give a name to a database, and rely on the deployer to map that name to an actual instance of the database.
For example, if you&#x27;re writing code that runs in a Java EE container, you can write this to get hold of the data source with JNDI name &quot;Database&quot;:
Note there&#x27;s nothing here about the database driver, or the user name, or the password. That is configured inside the container.
JNDI is not restricted to databases (JDBC); all sorts of services can be given names. For more details, you should check out the Sun tutorial on the subject.
