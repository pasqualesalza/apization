For this code block:
the value of d is 0.0. It can be forced to work by casting:
But is there another way to get the correct double result? I don&#x27;t like casting primitives, who knows what may happen.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int num = 5;
int denom = 7;
double d = num / denom;
double d = ((double) num) / denom;
```

That avoids a cast.  But you&#x27;ll find that the cast conversions are well-defined.  You don&#x27;t have to guess, just check the JLS.  int to double is a widening conversion.  From ยง5.1.2:
Widening primitive conversions do not
  lose information about the overall
  magnitude of a numeric value.
[...]
Conversion of an int or a long value
  to float, or of a long value to
  double, may result in loss of
  precision-that is, the result may lose
  some of the least significant bits of
  the value. In this case, the resulting
  floating-point value will be a
  correctly rounded version of the
  integer value, using IEEE 754
  round-to-nearest mode (ยง4.2.4).
5 can be expressed exactly as a double.
