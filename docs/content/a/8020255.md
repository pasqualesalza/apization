I&#x27;ve searched for this, but couldn&#x27;t find an answer and for whatever reason I was too ashamed to ask professor, due to that feeling when hundreds of people stare at you...
Anyhow, my question is what&#x27;s the importance of having brackets? Is it OK if I omit them? Example:

I know both of them will work, but if I omit the brackets (which I tend to do a lot, due to visibility) will that change anything, anything at all? As I said, I know it works, I tested it dozen of times, but now some of my uni assignments are getting larger, and for some reason I have irrational fear that in the long run, this my cause some problems? Is there a reason to fear that?

It won&#x27;t change anything at all apart from the maintainability of your code. I&#x27;ve seen code like this:
which means this:
... but which should have been this:
Personally I always include the brackets to reduce the possibility of confusion when reading or modifying the code.
The coding conventions at every company I&#x27;ve worked for have required this - which is not to say that some other companies don&#x27;t have different conventions...
And just in case you think it would never make a difference: I had to fix a bug once which was pretty much equivalent to the code above. It was remarkably hard to spot... (admittedly this was years ago, before I&#x27;d started unit testing, which would no doubt have made it easier to diagnose).
