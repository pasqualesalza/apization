I need to use regex, to check if a string starts with a double quotes character (&quot;) and ends with a double quotes character too.
The problem is I can&#x27;t use a double quotes character, cause it gets confused. Is there any other way to represent a double quotes character &quot; in regex, or in string in general?

## Original code snippet

Firstly, double quote character is nothing special in regex - it&#x27;s just another character, so it doesn&#x27;t need escaping from the perspective of regex.
However, because java uses double quotes to delimit String constants, if you want to create a string in java with a double quote in it, you must escape them.
This code will test if your String matches:
Note that you don&#x27;t need to add start and end of input markers (^ and $) in the regex, because matches() requires that the whole input be matched to return true - ^ and $ are implied.

```java
if (str.matches("\".*\"")) {
    // this string starts and end with a double quote
}
```
