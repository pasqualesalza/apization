I have a long set of comparisons to do in Java, and I&#x27;d like to know if one or more of them come out as true. The string of comparisons was long and difficult to read, so I broke it up for readability, and automatically went to use a shortcut operator |= rather than negativeValue = negativeValue || boolean.
I expect negativeValue to be true if any of the default&lt;something&gt; values are negative. Is this valid? Will it do what I expect? I couldn&#x27;t see it mentioned on Sun&#x27;s site or stackoverflow, but Eclipse doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it and the code compiles and runs.
Similarly, if I wanted to perform several logical intersections, could I use &amp;= instead of &amp;&amp;?

```java
boolean negativeValue = false;
negativeValue |= (defaultStock < 0);
negativeValue |= (defaultWholesale < 0);
negativeValue |= (defaultRetail < 0);
negativeValue |= (defaultDelivery < 0);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2486574

The |= is a compound assignment operator (JLS 15.26.2) for the boolean logical operator | (JLS 15.22.2); not to be confused with the conditional-or || (JLS 15.24). There are also &amp;= and ^= corresponding to the compound assignment version of the boolean logical &amp; and ^ respectively.
In other words, for boolean b1, b2, these two are equivalent:
The difference between the logical operators (&amp; and |) compared to their conditional counterparts (&amp;&amp; and ||) is that the former do not &quot;shortcircuit&quot;; the latter do. That is:
So going back to your original question, yes, that construct is valid, and while |= is not exactly an equivalent shortcut for = and ||, it does compute what you want. Since the right hand side of the |= operator in your usage is a simple integer comparison operation, the fact that | does not shortcircuit is insignificant.
There are cases, when shortcircuiting is desired, or even required, but your scenario is not one of them.
It is unfortunate that unlike some other languages, Java does not have &amp;&amp;= and ||=. This was discussed in the question Why doesn&#x27;t Java have compound assignment versions of the conditional-and and conditional-or operators? (&amp;&amp;=, ||=).
