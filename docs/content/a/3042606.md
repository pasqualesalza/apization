I have a few Set&lt;String&gt;s and want to transform each of these into a single String where each element of the original Set is separated by a whitespace &quot; &quot;.
A naive first approach is doing it like this
Can anyone think of a faster, prettier or more efficient way to do this?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Set<String> set_1;
Set<String> set_2;

StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
for (String str : set_1) {
  builder.append(str).append(" ");
}

this.string_1 = builder.toString();

builder = new StringBuilder();
for (String str : set_2) {
  builder.append(str).append(" ");
}

this.string_2 = builder.toString();
```

With commons/lang you can do this using StringUtils.join:
You can&#x27;t really beat that for brevity.
Update:
Re-reading this answer, I would prefer the other answer regarding Guava&#x27;s Joiner now. In fact, these days I don&#x27;t go near apache commons.
Another Update:
Java 8 introduced the method String.join()
While this isn&#x27;t as flexible as the Guava version, it&#x27;s handy when you don&#x27;t have the Guava library on your classpath.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String str_1 = StringUtils.join(set_1, " ");
String joined = String.join(",", set);
```
