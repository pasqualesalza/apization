I need to cast a double to an int in Java, but the numerical value must always round down. i.e. 99.99999999 -&gt; 99



## Original code snippet

Casting to an int implicitly drops any decimal. No need to call Math.floor() (assuming positive numbers)
Simply typecast with (int), e.g.:
This being said, it does have a different behavior from Math.floor which rounds towards negative infinity (@Chris Wong)

```java
System.out.println((int)(99.9999)); // Prints 99
