I received a codility test the other day for a job, as such I&#x27;ve been practicing using some of the problems from their training page

Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only been able to get 83/100 on the Tape-Equilibrium question:
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.
     Any integer P, such that 0 &lt; P &lt; N, splits this tape into two non−empty parts: A[0], A[1], …, A[P − 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], …, A[N − 1].
  The difference between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + … + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + … + A[N − 1])|
  In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.
Write a function that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.
Example:
      A[0] = 3
      A[1] = 1
      A[2] = 2
      A[3] = 4
      A[4] = 3
  We can split this tape in four places:
P = 1, difference = |3 − 10| = 7
P = 2, difference = |4 − 9| = 5
P = 3, difference = |6 − 7| = 1
P = 4, difference = |10 − 3| = 7
  In this case I would return 1 as it is the smallest difference.
N is an int, range [2..100,000];
  each element of A is an int, range [−1,000..1,000]. It needs to be O(n) time complexity,
My code is as follows:
I went a bit mad with the Math.abs. The two test areas it fails on are &quot;double&quot; (which I think is two values, -1000 and 1000, and &quot;small&quot;.

```java
import java.math.*;
class Solution {
public int solution(int[] A) {

    long sumright = 0;
    long sumleft = 0;
    long ans;

    for (int i =1;i<A.length;i++)
        sumright += A[i];

    sumleft = A[0];
    ans =Math.abs(Math.abs(sumright)+Math.abs(sumleft));

    for (int P=1; P<A.length; P++)
    {
        if (Math.abs(Math.abs(sumleft) - Math.abs(sumright))<ans)
            ans = Math.abs(Math.abs(sumleft) - Math.abs(sumright));
        sumleft += A[P];
        sumright -=A[P];
    }
    return (int) ans;  
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/19455451

Your solution is already O(N). You need to remove the abs from sumleft and sumright.
Also before the second for loop,
It should work.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if (Math.abs( sumleft - sumright ) < ans)
{
  ans = Math.abs( sumleft - sumright );
}
ans =Math.abs( sumleft - sumright );
```
