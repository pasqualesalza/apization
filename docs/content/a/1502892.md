As a java programmer who wishes to perfect his programming skills, I often come across the situations that I have to create a runtime exception. I know it&#x27;s a good practice if one use wisely.
Personally, NullPointerException and IllegalStateException are the most commonly used in the softwares that I have created. How about you?
What runtime exceptions do you often use? In what situations do you use them?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1502892

I never throw NullPointerException. For me, it is one that appears naturally in the code when something goes wrong and that requires a developer to look at what happens. Then (s)he fixes the cause and it doesn&#x27;t happen again.
I use IllegalStateException to signal that an object is incorrectly configured or that calls are in an incorrect order. However, we all know that ideally, an object should ensure it can&#x27;t be in a bad state and that you can&#x27;t call it in incorrect order (make a builder and a resulting object ...).
I use a lot of IllegalArgumentException when a method detects that its parameters are incorrect. This is the responsibility of any public method, to stop processing (to avoid indirect errors that are more difficult to understand). Also, a few ifs in the beginning of a method serve a documentation purpose (documentation that never diverge from the code because it is the code :-) ).
I also use specific Runtime Exceptions to signal higher level exceptional conditions.
For example, if a module of my application couldn&#x27;t start, I might have a ModuleNotOperationalException thrown (ideally by a generic code like an interceptor, otherwise by a specific code) when another module calls it. After that architectural decision, each module has to deal with this exception on operations that call other modules...
