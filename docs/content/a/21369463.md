How to find the remainder of dividing two numbers without using the modulo operator!! 
My teacher gave me this exact exercise and It&#x27;s only my 5th lecture in a course called programming fundamentals.
I have already tried this equation,
but it always returns zero!

```java
a%b = a - (a/b)*b
```

I&#x27;ve just tried this
And it seems to work. What types are your variables?

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public static void main (String [] args){
    int a = 50;
    int b = 9;

    int c = a%b;
    int d = a - (a/b)*b;

    System.out.println(c);
    System.out.println(d);
}
```
