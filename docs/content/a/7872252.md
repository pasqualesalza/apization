Is there any reason not to use %s for the format specifier when formatting numbers if no extra formatting is required?
e.g.
rather than the more usual:
The reason I&#x27;m asking is that I want to make some automated changes to source code, and it would be inconvenient to have to figure out whether the type of answer is int or String or something else


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int answer = 42;
String text = String.format("The answer is %s", answer);
int answer = 42;
String text = String.format("The answer is %d", answer);
```

I would expect there to be a potential difference in terms of thousands separators and other locale-specific options. The first approach is just going to call Integer.toString (which is not locale-sensitive) because Integer doesn&#x27;t implement Formattable. The second is going to use potentially locale-sensitive integer formatting - it could insert thousands separators, potentially even use a different set of digits etc.
Looking at the docs more carefully, it looks like grouping separators won&#x27;t be applied without a specific formatting flag, but:
Number Localization Algorithm
After digits are obtained for the integer part, fractional part, and exponent (as appropriate for the data type), the following transformation is applied:
Sample where it makes a difference:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.util.Locale;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Locale.setDefault(new Locale("hi", "IN"));
    System.out.printf("String: %s; Number: %d\n", 1234, 1234);
  }
