I have Java string:
I also have generated pattern against which I want to match this string:
When I say b.matches(pattern) it returns false. Now I know dollar sign is part of Java RegEx, but I don&#x27;t know how should my pattern look like. I am assuming that $ in pattern needs to be replaced by some escape characters, but don&#x27;t know how many. This $ sign is important to me as it helps me distinguish elements in list (numbers after dollar), and I can&#x27;t go without it.

```java
String b = "/feedback/com.school.edu.domain.feedback.Review$0/feedbackId");
String pattern = "/feedback/com.school.edu.domain.feedback.Review$0(.)*";
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3853731

You need to escape $ in the regex with a back-slash (\), but as a back-slash is an escape character in strings you need to escape the back-slash itself.
You will need to escape any special regex char the same way, for example with &quot;.&quot;.

```java
String pattern = "/feedback/com\\.navteq\\.lcms\\.common\\.domain\\.poi\\.feedback\\.Review\\$0(.)*";
```
