I&#x27;m writing a listener thread for a server, and at the moment I&#x27;m using:
With the code above, I&#x27;m running into issues with the run function eating all the cpu time looping.  The sleep function works, but it seems be a makeshift fix, not a solution.
Is there some function which would block until the variable &#x27;condition&#x27; became &#x27;true&#x27;?
Or is continual looping the standard method of waiting until a variable&#x27;s value changes?

while (true){

        if (condition){
            //do something
            condition=false;
        }
        sleep(1000);

    } catch (InterruptedException ex){
        Logger.getLogger(server.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);

Polling like this is definitely the least preferred solution.
I assume that you have another thread that will do something to make the condition true. There are several ways to synchronize threads. The easiest one in your case would be a notification via an Object:
Main thread:
Other thread:
syncObject itself can be a simple Object.
There are many other ways of inter-thread communication, but which one to use depends on what precisely you&#x27;re doing.

```java
synchronized(syncObject) {
    try {
        // Calling wait() will block this thread until another thread
        // calls notify() on the object.
        syncObject.wait();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Happens if someone interrupts your thread.
    }
}
// Do something
// If the condition is true, do the following:
synchronized(syncObject) {
    syncObject.notify();
}
```
