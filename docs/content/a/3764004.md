I would like to count the occurrences of a character in a string, suppose I have the string &quot;aaaab&quot;, how would i count the amount of a&#x27;s in it?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3764004

The code looks way easier to read if you don&#x27;t use regular expressions.
count now contains the number of &#x27;a&#x27;s in your string.  And, this performs in optimal time.
Regular expressions are nice for pattern matching.  But just a regular loop will get the job done here.

```java
int count = 0;
for(int i =0; i < string.length(); i++)
    if(string.charAt(i) == 'a')
        count++;
```
