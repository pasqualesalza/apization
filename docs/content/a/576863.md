I know how to do it normally, but I could swear that you could fill out out like a[0] = {0,0,0,0}; How do you do it that way? I did try Google, but I didn&#x27;t get anything helpful.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/576863

You can also do it as part of the declaration:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int[] a = new int[] {0, 0, 0, 0};
```
