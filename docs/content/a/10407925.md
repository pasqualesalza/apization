```java
public int getX(){
    return x;
}

public void setX(int x){
    this.x = x;
}
...(shape.x)...   // basically getX()
shape.x = 90;    // basically setX()
```


## Original code snippet

Multiple reasons:
If you allow field access like
shape.x = 90
then you cannot add any logic in future to validate the data.
say if x cannot be less than 100 you cannot do it, however if you had setters like
Though for constants like
you will allow field access as they cannot be changed, for instance variable you will place them with getters, setters.
Though in such cases you have to be careful in getter method to ensure you don&#x27;t give out reference of objects(in case your class have object as instances).
We can use the private variables in any package using getters and setters.
