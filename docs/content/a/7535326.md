I tried to break the string into arrays and replace \ with \\ , but couldn&#x27;t do it, also I tried String.replaceAll something like this (&quot;\&quot;,&quot;\\&quot;);.  I want to supply a path to JNI and it reads only in this way. Can someone help me on this please. Thank you.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/7535326

Don&#x27;t use String.replaceAll in this case - that&#x27;s specified in terms of regular expressions, which means you&#x27;d need even more escaping. This should be fine:
Note that the backslashes are doubled due to being in Java string literals - so the actual strings involved here are &quot;single backslash&quot; and &quot;double backslash&quot; - not double and quadruple.
replace works on simple strings - no regexes involved.

```
