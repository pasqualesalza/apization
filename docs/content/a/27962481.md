For my School project I had to show that I can utilize file handling within a program. For this I made a very simple login process that you can create an account on that writes a username and password to a text file located in the resource folder. Obviously this has no security at all as it wasn&#x27;t designed to be secure just to showcase file handling however my teacher has said that I should attempt to add some encryption to the file as well to get a better grade.
I have done some research and many people are recommending DES.
The problem I&#x27;m having is I don&#x27;t have much time left for my project and need to finish it asap. Using DES seems like it would take a while to implement all the extra code.
In my program I am using a simple lineNumberReader to read the files line by line. To write to the files I am using a BufferedWriter.
Is there anyway to encrypt this data very simply? It doesn&#x27;t have to be very secure but I need to show that I have atleast attempted to encrypt the data. The encryption and decryption would all be completed on the same application as data isn&#x27;t being transferred.
Potentially a way I can create a very simple encryption and decryption algorithm myself?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/27962481

Try this,... Its pretty simple
So basically before writing to file you will encrypt and after reading you will need to decrypt it.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;

public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        try{
            KeyGenerator keygenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");
            SecretKey myDesKey = keygenerator.generateKey();

            Cipher desCipher;
            desCipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES");


            byte[] text = "No body can see me.".getBytes("UTF8");


            desCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, myDesKey);
            byte[] textEncrypted = desCipher.doFinal(text);

            String s = new String(textEncrypted);
            System.out.println(s);

            desCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, myDesKey);
            byte[] textDecrypted = desCipher.doFinal(textEncrypted);

            s = new String(textDecrypted);
            System.out.println(s);
        }catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("Exception");
        }
    }
}
```
