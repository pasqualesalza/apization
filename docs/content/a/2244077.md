You can include a path for the program to be executed. On the Win plateform, you need to put the path in quotes if the path contains spaces.
If you need to pass arguments, it&#x27;s safer to a String array especially if they contain spaces.
If using the start command and the path of the file to be started contains a space then you must specified a title to the start command.
***Can anyone help me to put the above command in this code?***I dont know the syntax rules to put that command in the above code.Please help me.
This is the exact java code i am using:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(
       "\"c:/program files/windows/notepad.exe\"");
    p.waitFor();
  }
}
String[] cmd = { "myProgram.exe", "-o=This is an option" };
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
String fileName = "c:\\Applications\\My Documents\\test.doc";
String[] commands = {"cmd", "/c", "start", "\"DummyTitle\"",fileName};
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(commands);
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        String[] cmd = { "C:\\Program Files\\E.M. TVCC\\TVCC.exe", "-f C:\\Program Files\\E.M. TVCC\\01.avi", "-o C:\\Program Files\\E.M. TVCC\\target.3gp" };
        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
        p.waitFor();
    }
}
```

You&#x27;ve got all the pieces in your question.  It&#x27;s just a matter of putting it all together.
Something such as the following should work:
That said, hard coding paths like this isn&#x27;t a good idea, you should read them from somewhere; arguments to your program, a properties file, etc.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        String[] cmd = { "C:\\E.M. TVCC\\TVCC.exe", "-f E:\\TestVideo\\01.avi", "-o E:\\OutputFiles\\target.3gp" };
        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
        p.waitFor();
    }
}
```
