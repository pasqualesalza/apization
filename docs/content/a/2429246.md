Is there a way to turn a char into a String or a String with one letter into a char (like how you can turn an int into a double and a double into an int)? (please link to the relevant documentation if you can).
How do I go about finding something like this that I&#x27;m only vaguely aware of in the documentation?

You find the documentation by identifying the classes likely to be involved. Here, candidates are java.lang.String and java.lang.Character.
You should start by familiarizing yourself with:
It also helps to get introduced to the API more slowly through tutorials.
