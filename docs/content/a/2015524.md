I think I increased my heap size to 1 GB in NetBeans since I changed the config to look like this:
After I restarted NetBeans, can I be sure that my app is given 1 GB now?
Is there a way to verify this?

```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2015524

Use this code:
It was useful to me to know it.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
// Get current size of heap in bytes
long heapSize = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory(); 

// Get maximum size of heap in bytes. The heap cannot grow beyond this size.// Any attempt will result in an OutOfMemoryException.
long heapMaxSize = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory();

 // Get amount of free memory within the heap in bytes. This size will increase // after garbage collection and decrease as new objects are created.
long heapFreeSize = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
```
