I have been using java for quite some time, yet my education in loops is somewhat lacking.  I know how to create every loop that exists in java and break out of the loops as well. However, I&#x27;ve recently thought about this:
Say I have two nested loops. Could I break out of both loops using just one break statement?
Here is what I have so far.
Is there any way to achieve this?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int points = 0;
int goal = 100;
while (goal <= 100) {
   for (int i = 0; i < goal; i++) {
      if (points > 50) {
         break; //for loop ends, while loop does not
      }
   //I know I could put a 'break' statement here and end the while loop but I want to do it using just one 'break' statement
   points += i;
   }
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/6638330

In java you can use a label to specify which loop to break/continue:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
mainLoop:
while (goal <= 100) {
   for (int i = 0; i < goal; i++) {
      if (points > 50) {
         break mainLoop;
      }
      points += i;
   }
}
```
