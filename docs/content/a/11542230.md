I&#x27;d like to try a right triangle asterisk. But I only got this 
output: (I can&#x27;t place here the asterisk)
what I want is this:
Here&#x27;s the code that I programmed:
Any ideas to share are greatly appreciated. I&#x27;m a java newbie. thanks.

Your code never prints any spaces, that should be a problem.
You can use this simple approach:
The logic is quite simple: you have the string with two spaces and three at-signs. The first line of output needs to be two spaces and a single at-sign, so that&#x27;s the first three chars of the string. The second line should be one space and two at-signs—that&#x27;s the three chars of the string after skipping the first one; and so on: you just slide through the string, each time skipping one more from the beginning and taking the next three chars.
