Here&#x27;s the problem. This code:
returns
But this code:
returns
What in the world is going on? Seems there should be a simple enough solution, but I can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String a = "0000";
 System.out.println(a);
char[] b = a.toCharArray();
 System.out.println(b);
String a = "0000";
 System.out.println("String a: " + a);
char[] b = a.toCharArray();
 System.out.println("char[] b: " + b);
```


## Original code snippet

When you say
It results in a call to print(char[] s) then println()
The JavaDoc for print(char[] s) says:
Print an array of characters. The characters are converted into bytes
  according to the platform&#x27;s default character encoding, and these
  bytes are written in exactly the manner of the write(int) method.
So it performs a byte-by-byte print out.
When you say
It results in a call to print(String), and so what you&#x27;re actually doing is appending to a String an Object which invokes toString() on the Object -- this, as with all Object by default, and in the case of an Array, prints the value of the reference (the memory address).
You could do:
Note that this is &quot;wrong&quot; in the sense that you&#x27;re not paying any mind to encoding and are using the system default. Learn about encoding sooner rather than later.
