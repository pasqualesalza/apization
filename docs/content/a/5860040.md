You initialize an int variable defined within a method to have a value of 0 until you compute specific values for the int. What can one initialize char values to?
char retChar = &#x27;&#x27;;this gives an error and if I initialise to -1 it says too many characters.

Typically for local variables I initialize them as late as I can. It&#x27;s rare that I need a &quot;dummy&quot; value. However, if you do, you can use any value you like - it won&#x27;t make any difference, if you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re going to assign a value before reading it.
If you want the char equivalent of 0, it&#x27;s just Unicode 0, which can be written as
That&#x27;s also the default value for an instance (or static) variable of type char.
