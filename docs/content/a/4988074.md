I had a question about the indexOf method. I want to find multiple cases of &quot;X&quot; in a string.
Suppose my string is &quot;x is x is x is x&quot;, I want to find x in all of its index positions.
But how do you do this for multiple cases? Is this even possible with indexOf?
I did int temp = str.indexOf(&#x27;x&#x27;);
It find the first x. I tried to do a for loop where i is initialized to length of string and this did not work since I kept finding the first x over and over.
But this does not work. Am I supposed to use regex? Because I don&#x27;t really know how to use regex method.
Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

```java
for (int y = temp1; y >= 0;y-- ) 
{
    int temp = str.indexOf('x');
    System.out.println(temp);
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4988074

There is a second variant of the indexOf method, which takes a start-index as a parameter.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
i = str.indexOf('x');
while(i >= 0) {
     System.out.println(i);
     i = str.indexOf('x', i+1);
}
```
