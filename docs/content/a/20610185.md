My os is windows7. I want to read the environment variables in my Java application. I have searched google and many people&#x27;s answer is to use the method   System.getProperty(String name) or    System.getenv(String name). But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Through the method, I can read some variable&#x27;s value that defined in the JVM.
If I set an environment variable named &quot;Config&quot;, with value &quot;some config infomations&quot;, how can I get the value in Java?
Thanks for any help!



## Original code snippet

You should use System.getenv(), for example:
When running from an IDE you can define additional environment variable which will be passed to your Java application. For example in IntelliJ IDEA you can add environment variables in the &quot;Environment variables&quot; field of the run configuration.
Notice (as mentioned in the comment by @vikingsteve) that the JVM, like any other Windows executable, system-level changes to the environment variables are only propagated to the process when it is restarted.
For more information take a look at the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; section of the Java tutorial.
System.getProperty(String name) is intended for getting Java system properties which are not environment variables.

        for (String envName : env.keySet()) {
            System.out.format("%s=%s%n",
                              envName,
                              env.get(envName));
        }
