I have tried to delay - or put to sleep - my Java program, but an error occurs.
I&#x27;m unable to use Thread.sleep(x) or wait(). The same error message appears:
unreported exception java.lang.InterruptedException; must be caught or declared to be thrown.
Is there any step required before using the Thread.sleep() or wait() methods?



## Original code snippet

You have a lot of reading ahead of you. From compiler errors through exception handling, threading and thread interruptions. But this will do what you want:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
try {
    Thread.sleep(1000);                 //1000 milliseconds is one second.
} catch(InterruptedException ex) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
```
