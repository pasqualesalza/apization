Let&#x27;s say I needed to make a series of String[] objects.
I know that if i wanted to make a string array called &quot;test&quot; to hold 3 Strings I could do
String[] test = new String[3];
But let&#x27;s say I needed to make a series of these arrays and I wanted them to be named, 1,2, 3, 4, 5... etc.  For however many I needed and I didn&#x27;t know how many I&#x27;d need.
How do I achieve a similar effect to this:
Which would created 5 string arrays named 1 through 5.   Basically I want to be able to create array objects with a name detemined by some other function.  Why can&#x27;t I seem to do this?  Am I just being stupid?

There aren&#x27;t any &quot;variable variables&quot; (that is variables with variable names) in Java, but you can create Maps or Arrays to deal with your particular issue.  When you encounter an issue that makes you think &quot;I need my variables to change names dynamically&quot; you should try and think &quot;associative array&quot;.  In Java, you get associative arrays using Maps.
That is, you can keep a List of your arrays, something like:
Or perhaps a little closer to what you&#x27;re after, you can use a Map:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
List<String[]> kList = new ArrayList<String[]>();
for(int k = 0; k < 5; k++){
   kList.add(new String[3]);
}
Map<Integer,String[]> kMap = new HashMap<Integer,String[]>();
for(int k = 0; k < 5; k++){
  kMap.put(k, new String[3]);
}
// access using kMap.get(0) etc..
```
