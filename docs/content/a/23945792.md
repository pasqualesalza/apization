I am wondering if there is a way to get current milliseconds since 1-1-1970 (epoch) using the new LocalDate, LocalTime or LocalDateTime classes of Java 8.
The known way is below:
or

```java
long currentMilliseconds = new Date().getTime();
long currentMilliseconds = System.currentTimeMillis();
```

I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you mean by &quot;current milliseconds&quot; but I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s the number of milliseconds since the &quot;epoch,&quot; namely midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
If you want to find the number of milliseconds since the epoch right now, then use System.currentTimeMillis() as Anubian Noob has pointed out. If so, there&#x27;s no reason to use any of the new java.time APIs to do this.
However, maybe you already have a LocalDateTime or similar object from somewhere and you want to convert it to milliseconds since the epoch. It&#x27;s not possible to do that directly, since the LocalDateTime family of objects has no notion of what time zone they&#x27;re in. Thus time zone information needs to be supplied to find the time relative to the epoch, which is in UTC.

ZonedDateTime zdt = ldt.atZone(ZoneId.of("America/Los_Angeles"));
long millis = zdt.toInstant().toEpochMilli();
```
