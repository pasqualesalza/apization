Here is my code.  For some reason my BMI is not calculated correctly.
When I check the output on a calculator for this : (10/((10/100)^2))) I get 1000, but in my program, I get 5.  I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong.  Here is my code:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class BMI {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int height;
        int weight;
        String getweight;
        getweight = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Please enter your weight in Kilograms");
        String getheight;
        getheight = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Please enter your height in Centimeters");
        weight = Integer.parseInt(getweight);
        height = Integer.parseInt(getheight);
        double bmi;
        bmi = (weight/((height/100)^2));
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Your BMI is: " + bmi);
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

^ in java does not mean to raise to a power. It means XOR.
You can use java&#x27;s Math.pow()
And you might want to consider using double instead of int—that is:
Note that 199/100 evaluates to 1.
