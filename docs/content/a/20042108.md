## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/20042108

You need to make your roomsOccPercentage a double first.
and then cast either of the operands so avoid an integer division.
You can either use an explicit cast like (double)totalRoomsOccupied or just make 100 as 100.0 which is a floating point number, thus making the division too, a floating point one and not an integer division.

```java
double roomsOccPercentage = 0.0;
roomsOccPercentage = (totalRoomsOccupied * 100.0) / totalRooms;
```
