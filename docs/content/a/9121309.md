I need to take a String, and print each character of it on a seperate line.
I would use a for loop right?
Is what I have, but I keep getting NullPointExceptions. I have a method above that stores the password from the input, and the variable is defined in the class. So, I figured it would pull it from that.
My Question is: How would I take a string and print each character from it, one on each line?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public String toString(){
    for (int count=0; count < password.length(); count++)
    {
        System.out.print(password.charAt(count));
        System.out.print("\n");

    }
    return password; // I am confused on this. I don't want it to 
                       //return anything, really but I cannot make return type void



}
```


## Original code snippet

This would do the job:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "someString";
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    System.out.println(s.charAt(i));
}
```
