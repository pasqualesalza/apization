I am trying to open files with FileInputStream that have whitespaces in their names.
For example:
The result is that a FileNotFoundException is being thrown. 
I tried to hardcode the filePath to &quot;/home/myUserName/folder/This\\ is\\ my\\ file.txt&quot; just to see if i should escape whitespace characters and it did not seem to work.
Any suggestions on this matter?
EDIT: Just to be on the same page with everyone viewing this question...opening a file without whitespace in its name works, one that has whitespaces fails. Permissions are not the issue here nor the folder separator.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String fileName = "This is my file.txt";
String path = "/home/myUsername/folder/";

String filePath = path + filename;
f = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath));
```


## Original code snippet

File name with space works just fine
Here is my code
f.exists() returns true always without any problem

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
File f = new File("/Windows/F/Programming/Projects/NetBeans/TestApplications/database prop.properties");
        System.out.println(f.exists());
        try
        {
            FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(f);
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
        }
```
