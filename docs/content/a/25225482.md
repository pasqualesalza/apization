I have below String.
I would like to extract 2888 from here. That means, I need to extract characters after no in above string.
I&#x27;m always extract the number after the word no. The String contain no other no letter combinations elsewhere within it. String may contain other numbers and I don&#x27;t need to extract them. Always there will be a space before the number and the number I wish to extract always be at the end of the String.
How could I achieve this ?
