Trying to write a short method so that I can parse a string and extract the first word. I have been looking for the best way to do this.
I assume I would use str.split(&quot;,&quot;), however I would like to grab just the first first word from a string, and save that in one variable, and and put the rest of the tokens in another variable.
Is there a concise way of doing this?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5067969

The second parameter of the split method is optional, and if specified will split the target string only N times.
For example:
Alternatively you could use the substring method of String.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String mystring = "the quick brown fox";
String arr[] = mystring.split(" ", 2);

String firstWord = arr[0];   //the
String theRest = arr[1];     //quick brown fox
```
