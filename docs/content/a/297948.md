In Java, is there a way to have a window that is &quot;Always on top&quot; regardless if the user switches focus to another application?  I&#x27;ve searched the web, and all of the solutions lean to some sort of JNI interface with native bindings.  Truly this can&#x27;t be the only way to do it?.. or is it?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/297948

Try this method of the Window class:
Window.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean)
It works the same way as the default in the Windows TaskManager: switch to another app but it shows always on top.
This was added in Java 1.5
Sample code:

Window remains on top even when is not active

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JLabel;

public class Annoying {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello!!");

        // Set's the window to be "always on top"
        frame.setAlwaysOnTop( true );

        frame.setLocationByPlatform( true );
        frame.add( new JLabel("  Isn't this annoying?") );
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible( true );
    }
}
```
