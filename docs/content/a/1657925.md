I have an I2C device that wants two inputs: a denominator and a numerator. Both are written to separate addresses, so no actual calculation (numerator/denominator) is done. The problem with this is that a divide by zero could occur on the I2C device, so a divide by zero error needs to be checked for. Ideally, exactly the same thing would happen if the dividing were done by the java code.
At the moment, I&#x27;ve bodged an unused variable that does the division, but I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;ll get optimized out:
Surely there&#x27;s a better way!

```java
public void setKp(int numerator, int divisor)
{
    int zeroCheck = numerator / divisor;
    //... doesn't use zeroCheck
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1657925

You should not throw an ArithmeticException. Since the error is in the supplied arguments, throw an IllegalArgumentException. As the documentation says:
Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
Which is exactly what is going on here.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if (divisor == 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Argument 'divisor' is 0");
}
```
