I think you want to remove the last five characters (&#x27;.&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;u&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;):
Note how you need to use the return value - strings are immutable, so substring (and other methods) don&#x27;t change the existing string - they return a reference to a new string with the appropriate data.
Or to be a bit safer:
However, I would try to tackle the problem higher up. My guess is that you&#x27;ve only got the &quot;.null&quot; because some other code is doing something like this:
where extension is null. I would conditionalise that instead, so you never get the bad data in the first place.
