I&#x27;m basically trying to spilt a string on the last period to capture the file extension.
But Sometimes the file has NO extension, so i&#x27;m anticipating that.
But the problem is that some file names have periods before the end like so...
So when that string comes up it chops it at &quot;02 Drake - Connect (Feat.&quot;
This is what I&#x27;ve been using...
How do I split the string at the file extension but also be able to handle and alert when the file has no extension.

```java
/mnt/sdcard/OG Ron C, Chopstars & Drake - Choppin Ain't The Same-2013-MIXFIEND/02 Drake - Connect (Feat. Fat Pat) (Chopped Not Slopped).mp3
String filePath = intent.getStringExtra(ARG_FILE_PATH);
    String fileType = filePath.substring(filePath.length() - 4);
    String FileExt = null;
    try {
        StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(filePath, ".");
        String first = tokens.nextToken();
        FileExt = tokens.nextToken();
    }catch(NoSuchElementException e){
        customToast("the scene you chose, has no extension :(");
    }
    System.out.println("EXT " +FileExt);
    File fileToUpload = new File(filePath);

It might be easier to just assume that files which end with a dot followed by alphanumeric characters have extensions.
See the Java docs for regular expression patterns. Remember to escape the backslash because the pattern string needs the backslash.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int p=filePath.lastIndexOf(".");
String e=filePath.substring(p+1);
if( p==-1 || !e.matches("\\w+") ){/* file has no extension */}
else{ /* file has extension e */ }
```
