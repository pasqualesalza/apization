I am using this code to check that array is present in the HashMap.
But this prints False.
How can I check that array is present in the HashMap.
Thanks in advance.

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[]arg)
    {
     HashMap<int[],String> map= new HashMap<int[],String>();
     map.put(new int[]{1,2}, "sun");
     System.out.println(map.containsKey((new int[]{1,2})));
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

The problem is because the two int[] aren&#x27;t equal.
Map and other Java Collections Framework classes defines its interface in terms of equals. From Map API:
Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in terms of the equals method. For example, the specification for the containsKey(Object key) method says: &quot;returns true if and only if this map contains a mapping for a key k such that (key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k)).&quot;
Note that they don&#x27;t have to be the same object; they just have to be equals. Arrays in Java extends from Object, whose default implementation of equals returns true only on object identity; hence why it prints false in above snippet.
You can solve your problem in one of many ways:

```java
System.out.println(
    (new int[] { 1, 2 }).equals(new int[] { 1, 2 })
); // prints "false"
```
