I found several code snippet for running cmd commands through java class, but i could not get it,
This code for opening the cmd
And i found another links for adding other commands such as cd
http://www.coderanch.com/t/109753/Linux-UNIX/exec-command-cd-command-java
How to open the command prompt and insert commands using Java?
Can anyone help me to understand that..how can i cd a directory such as :
then run another commands on that directory.

```java
public void excCommand(String new_dir){
    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    try {
        rt.exec(new String[]{"cmd.exe","/c","start"});

    } catch (IOException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

}
cd C:\Program Files\Flowella

## Original code snippet

One way to run a process from a different directory to the working directory of your Java program is to change directory and then run the process in the same command line.  You can do this by getting cmd.exe to run a command line such as  cd some_directory &amp;&amp; some_program.
The following example changes to a different directory and runs dir from there.  Admittedly, I could just dir that directory without needing to cd to it, but this is only an example:
Note also that I&#x27;m using a ProcessBuilder to run the command.  Amongst other things, this allows me to redirect the process&#x27;s standard error into its standard output, by calling redirectErrorStream(true).  Doing so gives me only one stream to read from.
This gives me the following output on my machine:

        builder.redirectErrorStream(true);
        Process p = builder.start();
        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
        String line;
        while (true) {
            line = r.readLine();
