I have a program that needs to start on 1/1/09 and when I start a new day, my program will show the next day.
This is what I have so far:
I am getting the error found void but expected int, in &#x27;newDay = startDate.add(5, 1);&#x27;
What should I do?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
GregorianCalendar startDate = new GregorianCalendar(2009, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("d/M/yyyy"); 
public void setStart()
{
    startDate.setLenient(false);
    System.out.println(sdf.format(startDate.getTime()));
}

public void today()
{
    newDay = startDate.add(5, 1);
    System.out.println(newDay);
//I want to add a day to the start day and when I start another new day, I want to add another day to that.
}
```


## Original code snippet

The Calendar object has an add method which allows one to add or subtract values of a specified field.
For example,
The constants for specifying the field can be found in the &quot;Field Summary&quot; of the Calendar class.
Just for future reference, The Java API Specification contains a lot of helpful information about how to use the classes which are part of the Java API.
Update:
I am getting the error found void but
  expected int, in &#x27;newDay =
  startDate.add(5, 1);&#x27; What should I
  do?
The add method does not return anything, therefore, trying to assign the result of calling Calendar.add is not valid.
The compiler error indicates that one is trying to assign a void to a variable with the type of int. This is not valid, as one cannot assign &quot;nothing&quot; to an int variable.
Just a guess, but perhaps this may be what is trying to be achieved:
Output:
What needs to be considered is what Calendar actually is.
A Calendar is not a representation of a date. It is a representation of a calendar, and where it is currently pointing at. In order to get a representation of where the calendar is pointing at at the moment, one should obtain a Date from the Calendar using the getTime method.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(2009, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);
c.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
// Get a calendar which is set to a specified date.
Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar(2009, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);

// Get the current date representation of the calendar.
Date startDate = calendar.getTime();

// Increment the calendar's date by 1 day.
calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);

// Get the current date representation of the calendar.
Date endDate = calendar.getTime();

System.out.println(startDate);
System.out.println(endDate);
