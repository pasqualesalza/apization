In my code I have a for loop that iterates through a method of code until it meets the for condition.
Is there anyway to break out of this for loop?
So if we look at the code below, what if we want to break out of this for loop when we get to &quot;15&quot;?
I&#x27;ve tried the following to no avail:
And I&#x27;ve tried a loop:
The only way I can achieve what I want to is by breaking out of a for loop, I cannot subsitute it for a while, do, if etc statement.
Edit:
This was provided only as an example, this isn&#x27;t the code I&#x27;m trying to get it implemented into. I have now solved the problem by placing multiple IF statements after where each loop initilizes. Before it would onlu jump out of one part of the loop due to lack of breaks;

```java
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {

      for(int x = 10; x < 20; x = x+1) {
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}

Outputs:

value of x : 10
value of x : 11
value of x : 12
value of x : 13
value of x : 14
value of x : 15
value of x : 16
value of x : 17
value of x : 18
value of x : 19
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      boolean breakLoop = false;
      while (!breakLoop) {
          for(int x = 10; x < 20; x = x+1) {
             System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
             System.out.print("\n");
          if (x = 15) {
              breakLoop = true;
          }
          }
      }
   }
}
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      breakLoop:
          for(int x = 10; x < 20; x = x+1) {
             System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
             System.out.print("\n");
             if (x = 15) {
                 break breakLoop;
             }
      }
   }
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15275222

break; is what you need to break out of any looping statement like for, while or do-while.
In your case, its going to be like this:-

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
for(int x = 10; x < 20; x++) {
         // The below condition can be present before or after your sysouts, depending on your needs.
         if(x == 15){
             break; // A unlabeled break is enough. You don't need a labeled break here.
         }
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         System.out.print("\n");
}
```
