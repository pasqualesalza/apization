Apparently Java&#x27;s Regex flavor counts Umlauts and other special characters as non-&quot;word characters&quot; when I use Regex.
returns &quot;TESTTEST&quot; for me. What I want is for only all truly non-&quot;word characters&quot; to be removed. Any way to do this without having something along the lines of
only to realize I forgot ô?

```java
"TESTÜTEST".replaceAll( "\\W", "" )
"[^A-Za-z0-9äöüÄÖÜßéèáàúùóò]"
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1612015

Use [^\p{L}\p{Nd}]+ - this matches all (Unicode) characters that are neither letters nor (decimal) digits.
In Java:
Edit:
I changed \p{N} to \p{Nd} because the former also matches some number symbols like ¼; the latter doesn&#x27;t. See it on regex101.com.

```java
String resultString = subjectString.replaceAll("[^\\p{L}\\p{Nd}]+", "");
```
