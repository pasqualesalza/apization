I&#x27;ve never done this before and can&#x27;t find the answer. This may not be the correct data type to use for this, but I just want to assign an int, then another int without a for loop into a 2D array, the values will actual be returns from another function, but for simplicity I&#x27;ve just used int i and k, this is how I thought you&#x27;d do it, but its not:
TIA - feel free to point me in the direction of a better data struct to do this if I&#x27;m barking up the wrong tree.

```java
int contents[][] = new int[2][2];
            contents[0][0] = {int i, int k}
            contents[1][1] = {int i, int k}
            contents[2][2] = {int i, int k}
```

The best way is probably to just declare and assign all values at once.  As shown here.
Java will automatically figure out what size the array is and assign the values to like this.
Alternatively if you need to declare the array first, remember that each contents[0][0] points to a single integer value not an array of two.  So to get the same assignment as above you would write:
Finally I should note that 2 by 2 array is index from 0 to 1 not 0 to 2.
Hope that helps.

```java
int contents[][] = { {1, 2} , { 4, 5} };
contents[0][0] = 1;
contents[0][1] = 2;
contents[1][0] = 4;
contents[1][1] = 5;
```
