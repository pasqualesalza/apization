I found a brilliant RegEx to extract the part of a camelCase or TitleCase expression.
It works as expected:
For example with Java:
My problem is that it does not work in some cases:
To my mind, the result shoud be:
In other words, given n uppercase chars:
Any idea on how to improve this regex?

```java
(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])
String s = "loremIpsum";
words = s.split("(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])");
//words equals words = new String[]{"lorem","Ipsum"}
```


## Original code snippet

The following regex works for all of the above examples:
It works by forcing the negative lookbehind to not only ignore matches at the start of the string, but to also ignore matches where a capital letter is preceded by another capital letter. This handles cases like &quot;VALUE&quot;.
The first part of the regex on its own fails on &quot;eclipseRCPExt&quot; by failing to split between &quot;RPC&quot; and &quot;Ext&quot;. This is the purpose of the second clause: (?&lt;!^)(?=[A-Z][a-z]. This clause allows a split before every capital letter that is followed by a lowercase letter, except at the start of the string.

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    for (String w : "camelValue".split("(?<!(^|[A-Z]))(?=[A-Z])|(?<!^)(?=[A-Z][a-z])")) {
        System.out.println(w);
    }
}
```
