I have the following Java code:
The result is 254 when printed, but I have no idea how this code works. If the &amp; operator is simply bitwise, then why does it not result in a byte and instead an integer?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
byte value = 0xfe; // corresponds to -2 (signed) and 254 (unsigned)
int result = value & 0xff;
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/11380077

It sets result to the (unsigned) value resulting from putting the 8 bits of value in the lowest 8 bits of result.
The reason something like this is necessary is that byte is a signed type in Java. If you just wrote:
then result would end up with the value ff ff ff fe instead of 00 00 00 fe. A further subtlety is that the &amp; is defined to operate only on int values1, so what happens is:
(The point is that conversion to int happens before the &amp; operator is applied.)
1Well, not quite. The &amp; operator works on long values as well, if either operand is a long. But not on byte. See the Java Language Specification, sections 15.22.1 and 5.6.2.
