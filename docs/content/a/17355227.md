Is this a correct approach to convert ByteBuffer to String in this way,
The reason I ask is that is this looks too simple, whereas other approaches like Java: Converting String to and from ByteBuffer and associated problems looks more complex.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String k = "abcd";
ByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.wrap(k.getBytes());
String v = new String(b.array());

if(k.equals(v))
    System.out.println("it worked");
else
    System.out.println("did not work");
```

Your approach would be reasonable if you knew the bytes are in the platform&#x27;s default charset. In your example, this is true because k.getBytes() returns the bytes in the platform&#x27;s default charset.
More frequently, you&#x27;ll want to specify the encoding. However, there&#x27;s a simpler way to do that than the question you linked. The String API provides methods that converts between a String and a byte[] array in a particular encoding. These methods suggest using CharsetEncoder/CharsetDecoder &quot;when more control over the decoding [encoding] process is required.&quot;
To get the bytes from a String in a particular encoding, you can use a sibling getBytes() method:
To put bytes with a particular encoding into a String, you can use a different String constructor:
Note that ByteBuffer.array() is an optional operation. If you&#x27;ve constructed your ByteBuffer with an array, you can use that array directly. Otherwise, if you want to be safe, use ByteBuffer.get(byte[] dst, int offset, int length) to get bytes from the buffer into a byte array.
EDIT
As a side issue, in the sample code above the call to Charset.forName(&quot;UTF-8&quot;) should work for all versions of Java since 1.4.
If you&#x27;re using Java 7 or later, you can instead use java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8. (Noted by BenKirby in his comment below.)
