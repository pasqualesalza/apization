I&#x27;m trying to convert the String \something\ into the String \\something\\ using replaceAll, but I keep getting all kinds of errors. I thought this was the solution:
But this gives the below exception:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
theString.replaceAll("\\", "\\\\");
java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Unexpected internal error near index 1
```


## Original code snippet

The String#replaceAll() interprets the argument as a regular expression. The \ is an escape character in both String and regex. You need to double-escape it for regex:
But you don&#x27;t necessarily need regex for this, simply because you want an exact character-by-character replacement and you don&#x27;t need patterns here. So String#replace() should suffice:
Update: as per the comments, you appear to want to use the string in JavaScript context. You&#x27;d perhaps better use StringEscapeUtils#escapeEcmaScript() instead to cover more characters.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
string.replaceAll("\\\\", "\\\\\\\\");
string.replace("\\", "\\\\");
```
