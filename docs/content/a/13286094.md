So basically what I want is to find out that elements of a which is not present in arraylist b.
So what is the best solutions to do that?

```java
Arraylist a,b, 

Arraylist a={1,2,3,4,5};
Arraylist b={2,3,4};
```

Also consider to use Sets instead of Lists.

```java
List<Integer> c = new ArrayList<>(a);
c.removeAll(b);
```
