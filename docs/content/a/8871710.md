I have a string say 123dance456 which I need to split into two strings containing the first sub-string before the sub-string dance (i.e. 123) and after the sub-string dance (i.e. 456). I need to find them and hold them in separate string variables, say String firstSubString = 123; and String secondSubString = 456;.
Is there any given String method that does just that?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/8871710

You can use String.split(String regex). Just do something like this:
Please note that if &quot;dance&quot; occurs more than once in the original string, split() will split on each occurrence -- that&#x27;s why the return value is an array.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "123dance456";
String[] split = s.split("dance");
String firstSubString = split[0];
String secondSubString = split[1];
```
