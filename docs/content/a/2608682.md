I would like to trim a beginning and ending double quote (&quot;) from a string.
How can I achieve that in Java? Thanks!



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2608682

You can use String#replaceAll() with a pattern of ^\&quot;|\&quot;$ for this.
E.g.
To learn more about regular expressions, have al ook at http://regular-expression.info.
That said, this smells a bit like that you&#x27;re trying to invent a CSV parser. If so, I&#x27;d suggest to look around for existing libraries, such as OpenCSV.
