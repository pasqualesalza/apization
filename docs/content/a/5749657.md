Your number exceeds the precision of the 52 fractional bits that represent the significand, see IEEE 754-1985. Use this floating-point conversion to see your number in binary. The exponent is 18 since 262144 (2^18) is nearest. If you take the fractional bits and go up or down one in binary, you can see there's not enough precision to represent your number:"

You&#x27;ve reached the maximum precision for a double with that number. It can&#x27;t be done. The value gets rounded up in this case. The conversion from BigDecimal is unrelated and the precision problem is the same either way. See this for example:
Output is:
For these cases double has more than 3 digits of precision after the decimal point. They just happen to be zeros for your number and that&#x27;s the closest representation you can fit into a double. It&#x27;s closer for it to round up in this case, so your 9&#x27;s seem to disappear. If you try this:
You&#x27;ll notice that it keeps your 9&#x27;s because it was closer to round down:
