I am very new to java, and this seems very simple, perhaps I am missing something.
Below is a little bit of my code, what it should do is have the user enter the a password, which is stored in userinput, unfortunately if I type admin which I have it set to == &quot;admin&quot; it will not work, even if I do all caps or all lowercase like I have it.
I even tried pre-setting a variable such as String password = &quot;admin&quot;; and having it set to be if (userinput == password) but that did not seem to work either. Please help!
Quick summary, no matter what password I type, even if it is &quot;admin&quot; it goes right to wrong.

```java
}
    public void protect(){
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter password: ");
        String userinput = input.nextLine();
        if (userinput == "admin"){
            System.out.println("Correct!");
        } else if (userinput != "admin"){
            System.out.println("Wrong!");
        }
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

You can&#x27;t compare strings like that.  Use .equals() instead:
Why, you ask?

```java
if(userinput.equals("admin")) { // etc
```
