Determining the Fibonacci sequence is easy enough to figure out:
My problem lies with trying to pinpoint the value for a specified N. As in, If I want to find the 6th element in the sequence, which is 8, how would I find that number, and only that number?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int num = 0;
int num2 = 1;
int loop;
int fibonacci;
System.out.print(num2);
for (loop = 1; loop <= 10; loop ++)
{
    fibonacci = num + num2;
    num = num2;
    num2 = fibonacci;
    System.out.print(" " + fibonacci);
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13021152

In your code, num starts as the 0th Fibonacci number, and num1 as the 1st. So to find the nth, you have to iterate the step n times:
and only print it when you&#x27;ve finished.
When the loop counter loop has the value k, num holds the kth Fibonacci number and num2 the (k+1)th.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
for (loop = 0; loop < n; loop ++)
{
    fibonacci = num + num2;
    num = num2;
    num2 = fibonacci;
}
System.out.print(num);
```
