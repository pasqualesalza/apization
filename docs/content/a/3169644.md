When and how should we use a Constructor
And When and how should we use getInstance() (static factory methods)
What is the difference between these two, I always use the 1st way but when to use the 2nd way?

```java
Foo bar = new Foo();
Foo bar = Foo.getInstance();
```

Everybody seems to focus on singletons while I think that the question is actually about constructor vs static factory methods.
This is actually Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors of  Effective Java by Joshua Bloch:
The normal way for a class to allow a
  client to obtain an instance of itself
  is to provide a public constructor.
  There is another technique that should
  be a part of every programmer’s
  toolkit. A class can provide a public
  static factory method, which is simply a static method that returns an
  instance of the class. Here’s a simple
  example from Boolean (the boxed
  primitive class for the primitive type
  boolean). This method translates a
  boolean primitive value into a
  Boolean object reference:
Note that a static factory method is
  not the same as the Factory Method
  pattern from Design Patterns
  [Gamma95, p. 107]. The static factory
  method described in this item has no
  direct equivalent in Design
  Patterns.
A class can provide its clients with
  static factory methods instead of, or
  in addition to, constructors.
  Providing a static factory method
  instead of a public constructor has
  both advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages (quoting the book):
Disadvantages (still quoting the book):
