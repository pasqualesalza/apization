I seem to be having issues. I have a query string that has values that can contain single quotes. This will break the query string. So I was trying to do a replace to change &#x27; to \&#x27;.
Here is a sample code:
The output for this is still:
It thinks I am just doing an escape character for the quote.
So I tried these two pieces of code:
Both of the above STILL results in the same output:
I can only seem to get this to actually spit out a slash with:
Which results in:
Any suggestions? I just want to replace a &#x27; with \&#x27;.
It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be that difficult.

```java
"This is' it".replace("'", "\'");
"This is' it".
"This is' it".replace("'", "\\'");  // \\ for the backslash, and a ' char
"This is' it".replace("'", "\\\'"); // \\ for the backslash, and \' for the ' char
"This is' it"
"This is' it".replace("'", "\\\\'");
"This is\\' it"
```

First of all, if you are trying to encode apostophes for querystrings, they need to be URLEncoded, not escaped with a leading backslash. For that use URLEncoder.encode(String, String) (BTW: the second argument should always be &quot;UTF-8&quot;). Secondly, if you want to replace all instances of apostophe with backslash apostrophe, you must escape the backslash in your string expression with a leading backslash. Like this:
I see now that you are probably trying to dynamically build a SQL statement. Do not do it this way. Your code will be susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Instead use a PreparedStatement.
