An 64-bit double can represent integer +/- 253 exactly
Given this fact I choose to use a double type as a single type for all my types, since my largest integer is unsigned 32-bit.
But now I have to print these pseudo integers, but the problem is they are also mixed in with actual doubles.
So how do I print these doubles nicely in Java?
I have tried String.format(&quot;%f&quot;, value), which is close, except I get a lot of trailing zeros for small values.
Here&#x27;s an example output of of %f
What I want is:
Sure I can write a function to trim those zeros, but that&#x27;s lot of performance loss due to String manipulation.  Can I do better with another format code?
EDIT
The answers by Tom E. and Jeremy S. are unacceptable as they both arbitrarily rounds to 2 decimal places.  Please understand the problem before answering.
EDIT 2
Please note that String.format(format, args...) is locale-dependent (see answers below).

If the idea is to print integers stored as doubles as if they are integers, and otherwise print the doubles with the minimum necessary precision:
Produces:
And does not rely on string manipulation.
