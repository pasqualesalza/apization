So I am not sure why this is becoming so hard for me, but I need to sort high to low and low to high.
For high to low I have:
However, I can&#x27;t for the life of me get it to work in reverse (low to high), I have thought the logic through and it always returns 0&#x27;s for all the values.
Any help appreciated!
The bigger picture is that I have a JTable with 4 columns, each column with entries of numbers, names, or dates. I need to be able to sort those back and forth.
Thanks!

int sortTheNumbers = len - 1;

for (a = 0; a < sortTheNumbers; ++a) {
    for (b = 0; b < sortTheNumbers; ++b) {

            temp = array[b];
            array[b] = array[b + 1];

Unless you think using already available sort functions and autoboxing is cheating:
Prints low to high:[1, 6, 9, 12, 31, 34, 67, 78]
if you need high to low change x-y  to y-x in the comparator

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Integer[] arr =
    { 12, 67, 1, 34, 9, 78, 6, 31 };
    Arrays.sort(arr, new Comparator<Integer>()
    {
        @Override
        public int compare(Integer x, Integer y)
        {
            return x - y;
        }
    });

    System.out.println("low to high:" + Arrays.toString(arr));
```
