I want to get the current time in UTC. What I do so far is following (just for testing purposes):
My local time zone is UTC+1 (according to the debug output and the list here: http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/timezones.html)...
How do I correctly convert from one time zone to another (inlcusive the millisecond representation)?
EDIT
I need the date/milliseconds... It&#x27;s NOT about displaying the time correctly....
EDIT 2
Now, with the help of a comment and an answer, I tried following:
OUTPUT
What I wanted was, that the local date displays 15 o&#x27;clock and utc date displays 14 o&#x27;clock...
For now, this seems to work...
----- EDIT3 - Final solution -----
Hopefully, this is a good solution... I think, i respects all tipps i got...

You&#x27;re making it far more complicated than you need to:
No conversion required at all. If you find you actually need to convert, you can use withZone. I&#x27;d suggest you avoid going via LocalDateTime, however, as that way you can lose information due to time zone transitions (two different instants can have the same local time in the same time zone, because clocks go back and repeat local time.
Having said all of this, for the sake of testability I personally like using a Clock interface which allows me to get the current time (e.g. as an Instant). You can then use dependency injection to inject a real system clock when running in production, and a fake clock with a preset time for tests. Java 8&#x27;s java.time package has this idea built into it, btw.
