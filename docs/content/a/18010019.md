I was recently looking into freeing up memory occupied by Java objects. While doing that I got confused about how objects are copied (shallow/deep) in Java and how to avoid accidently clearing/nullifying objects while they are still in use.
Consider following scenarios:
Now in these case, if I call list = null; or list.clear();, what happens to the objects? In which case the objects are lost and in which cases only the reference is set to null?
I guess it has to do with shallow and deep copying of objects, but in which cases does shallow copying happens and in which case does deep copy happens in Java?



## Original code snippet

Firstly, you never set an object to null. That concept has no meaning. You can assign a value of null to a variable, but you need to distinguish between the concepts of &quot;variable&quot; and &quot;object&quot; very carefully. Once you do, your question will sort of answer itself :)
Now in terms of &quot;shallow copy&quot; vs &quot;deep copy&quot; - it&#x27;s probably worth avoiding the term &quot;shallow copy&quot; here, as usually a shallow copy involves creating a new object, but just copying the fields of an existing object directly. A deep copy would take a copy of the objects referred to by those fields as well (for reference type fields). A simple assignment like this:
... doesn&#x27;t do either a shallow copy or a deep copy in that sense. It just copies the reference. After the code above, list1 and list2 are independent variables - they just happen to have the same values (references) at the moment. We could change the value of one of them, and it wouldn&#x27;t affect the other:
Now if instead of changing the variables, we make a change to the object that the variables&#x27; values refer to, that change will be visible via the other variable too:
So back to your original question - you never store actual objects in a map, list, array etc. You only ever store references. An object can only be garbage collected when there are no ways of &quot;live&quot; code reaching that object any more. So in this case:
... the ArrayList object still can&#x27;t be garbage collected, because the Map has an entry which refers to it.

ArrayList<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<String> list2 = list1;
list1 = null;
System.out.println(list2.size()); // Just prints 0
list2.add("Foo");
System.out.println(list1.get(0)); // Prints Foo
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();
map.put("Foo", list);
list = null;
