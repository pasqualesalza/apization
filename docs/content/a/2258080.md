I have a specific function that I want to be executed after 5 seconds.
How can i do that in Java?
I found javax.swing.timer, but I can&#x27;t really understand how to use it. It looks like I&#x27;m looking for something way simpler then this class provides.
Please add a simple usage example.

EDIT:
javadoc says:
After the last live reference to a Timer object goes away and all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer&#x27;s task execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage collection). However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.
