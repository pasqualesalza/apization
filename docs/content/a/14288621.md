I have NetBeans project from tutorial  which causes exception:
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library   &#x27;simpleDLL&#x27;: The specified module could not be found.
Tried to put simpleDLL.dll in project libraries, copied file in system32 folder with no success.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/14288621

I had exactly the same problem with loading a DLL, I solved it in this way:
If the DLL is compatible, then the problem may be in your java library path. I put my DLL into the user.dir directory and then I used this code:
Set Java library path to user.dir or maybe another path you want:
Load the library:
System.loadLibrary(&quot;libraryWithoutDLLExtension&quot;);
It worked for me, try it and tell me if it works for you.

```java
String myLibraryPath = System.getProperty("user.dir");//or another absolute or relative path

System.setProperty("java.library.path", myLibraryPath);
```
