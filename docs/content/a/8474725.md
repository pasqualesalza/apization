I know there are similar questions to this one on SO (like this one), however, after reading through the list of &quot;Questions with similar titles&quot;, I still feel strongly that this is unique.
I am working with the iText library to generate PDFs from inside a Swing application. iText&#x27;s Jpeg class requires a URL in its constructor to locate an image/jpg that you want to add to the PDF file.
When I set this URL to the absolute file path of my JPG file, I get a MalformedURLException claiming unknown protocol: c (&quot;c&quot; being the C:\ drive on my local disk).
Is there any hack/circumvention to this, or do I have to host this JPG somewhere and have the URL find it over the net?  Here is the code that is failing:
Please note: The URL does properly escape the string (thus &quot;\&quot; are converted to &quot;\ \&quot;, etc.).
Thanks in advance!


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
try {
    String imageUrl = "C:\Users\MyUser\image.jpg";
    Jpeg image = new Jpeg(new URL(imageUrl));
} catch(Exception exc) {
    System.out.println(exc.getMessage());
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/8474725

You need to turn the path to the image.jpg file into a file:// URL, like this:
Otherwise it interprets the C as the URL protocol.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String imageUrl = "file:///C:/Users/MyUser/image.jpg";
```
