I have imported the following
import javax.servlet.http.*;
I want to get the preferred language Browser
I get an error HttpServletRequest cannot be resolved.
Can somebody help me and give me a step by step instruction if possible. I am not a java developer but a .net one and just fixing a bug.

The javax.servlet.http package is part of the servlet API. The relevant jars can be found in Java EE containers (such as Sun&#x27;s Glassfish) or stand-alone servlet containers (like Apache&#x27;s Tomcat). Essentially, these are Java web servers.
