I&#x27;m writing small app and now I discovered a problem.
I need to call one(later maybe two) method (this method loads something and returns the result) without lagging in window of app.
I found classes like Executor or Callable, but I don&#x27;t understand how to work with those ones.
Can you please post any solution, which helps me?
Thanks for all advices.

Firstly, I would recommend looking at the Java Thread Documentation.
With a Thread, you can pass in an interface type called a Runnable. The documentation can be found here. A runnable is an object that has a run method. When you start a thread, it will call whatever code is in the run method of this runnable object. For example:
Now, what this means is when you call t.start(), it will run whatever code you need it to without lagging the main thread. This is called an Asynchronous method call, which means that it runs in parallel to any other thread you have open, like your main thread. :)

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
         @Override
         public void run() {
              // Insert some method call here.
         }
});
```
