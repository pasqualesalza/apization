In C#
In Java, this errors with
Cannot instantiate the type
  Dictionary
What could be wrong?
In my code this follows with
I know this sounds too trivial. But I am at a loss!
If Dictionary doesn&#x27;t do it(which I strongly suspect by now), then which DataStructure to use.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4633580

Dictionary is an abstract class in Java.  It is also obsolete; you should use the Map interface instead; something like:
Note that HashMap&lt;K,V&gt; is a concrete class, but we&#x27;re assigning it to a Map&lt;K,V&gt; reference, which is an interface.  This is the recommended style in Java, because it allows you to switch HashMap for e.g. Hashtable at a later stage, without having to change everything.

```java
Map<String,String> map = new HashMap<String,String>();
```
