I have a breakpoint on a line where is the System.out.println(&quot;test&quot;) command.
I believe that the command is reached by execution because I see the printed string &quot;test&quot;.
But the breakpoint is ignored.
Breakpoint is a red circle all the time, without a tick or cross.
I think this is an issue when IDEA thinks the class is not loaded, while it is, because the command is executed.
I can reproduce it in various circumstances:
When I press debug (with maven configuration install exec:exec -DforkMode=never)
Remote debugging - I run maven goal in debug mode in the console:
mvnDebug install exec:exec -DforkMode=never
or
mvnDebug install exec:exec
remote debug configuration in IDEA:
In both cases the debugger only prints &quot;Connected to the target VM, address: &#x27;localhost:8000&#x27;, transport: &#x27;socket&#x27;&quot;
I have also tried File &gt; Invalidate Caches / Restart
and clean build, but the breakpoint is still ignored.
Configuration:
Ubuntu 13.10
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate build 133.944
Apache Maven 3.0.4
Java version: 1.7.0_51, vendor: Oracle Corporation
OS name: &quot;linux&quot;, version: &quot;3.11.0-17-generic&quot;, arch: &quot;amd64&quot;, family: &quot;unix&quot;

My solution:
Considering that you have a program that depends on system properties:
And you are running it with exec:exec:
With some &quot;inception magic&quot; we can debug the process started by Mavenexec:exec.
Change your exec:exec goal to enable remote debugging. I&#x27;m using suspend=y and server=n, but feel free to configure the JDWP Agent as you please:
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=n,address=127.0.0.1:8000,suspend=y
This will not be passed directly to the maven JVM, instead it will be passed to exec.args which will be used by exec:exec:
Create a Remote configuration (again I&#x27;m using a Listen strategy. You should adjust it according to your process settings):

Now toggle your breakpoints and Debug your remote configuration. Using the settings above it will wait until your process starts:

Finally run the exec:exec line above and debug your application at will:

So basically you need two &quot;Run/Debug&quot; configurations for this to work:
A Maven configuration for exec:exec with the system properties and JDWP agent configuration:

The remote configuration acting as a client.

    private static final String GREETING = System.getProperty("greeting", "Hi");

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        System.out.println(GREETING);
    }
}
mvn exec:exec -Dexec.executable=java "-Dexec.args=-classpath %classpath -Dgreeting=\"Hello\" com.mycompany.app.App"
mvn exec:exec -Dexec.executable=java "-Dexec.args=-classpath %classpath -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=n,address=127.0.0.1:8000,suspend=y -Dgreeting=\"Hello\" com.mycompany.app.App"
