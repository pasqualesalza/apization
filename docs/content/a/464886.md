I&#x27;m currently working on a Java project that is emitting the following warning when I compile:
I&#x27;m not sure how SO will render the character before the date, but it should be a copyright symbol, and is displayed in the warning as a question mark in a diamond.
It&#x27;s worth noting that the character appears in the output artifact correctly, but the warnings are a nuisance and the file containing this class may one day be touched by a text editor that saves the encoding incorrectly...
How can I inject this character into the &quot;copyright&quot; string so that the compiler is happy, and the symbol is preserved in the file without potential re-encoding issues?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
/src/com/myco/apps/AppDBCore.java:439: warning: unmappable character for encoding UTF8
    [javac]         String copyright = "ï¿½ 2003-2008 My Company. All rights reserved.";
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/464886

Use the &quot;\uxxxx&quot; escape format.
According to Wikipedia, the copyright symbol is unicode U+00A9 so your line should read:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String copyright = "\u00a9 2003-2008 My Company. All rights reserved.";
```
