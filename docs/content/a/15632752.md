My application has lot of iterations. Till now I haven&#x27;t faced any memory issues. But from code level I can suspect there are few places, which causes memory leaks and out of memory problem. I am thinking of calling garbage collector manually. Is it good practice to call Garbage Collector manually?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15632752

You can call Garbage collector using:
But this does not mean that it&#x27;ll be executed immediately. The JVM decides when to execute it. In general if the JVM is about to throw an OutOfMemoryError, calling System.gc() won&#x27;t prevent it. Better investigate why you&#x27;re leaking so much memory and clean it up along the way.
JavaDoc:
Calling the gc method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
  effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory
  they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control returns
  from the method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort
  to reclaim space from all discarded objects
