I&#x27;m running a comparison program and at the minute it does a direct &#x27;string-to-string&#x27; comparison and if they are an exact match it outputs that they are a match.
Well, I was hoping to add an additional feature that allowed for &#x27;similarity&#x27;...
so for example:
This is sort of a snippet of the code. I&#x27;d like it so that it skips over the &quot;00&quot; and still recognises it as &#x27;almost&#x27; the same number and still outputs it.
I&#x27;d imagine it would look something like String em2 = &quot;524&quot;+ ## +&quot;646&quot; but thats obviously just a concept
Does anyone know if there is a way to have this kind of &#x27;wildcard&#x27; (a term I&#x27;ve picked up from uni SQL) or if there is another way to do this similarity type deal.
Thanks :)


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String em1 = "52494646";
String em2 = "52400646";


if (em1.equals(em2)){
    output.writeUTF(dir + filenames[i]);
}
```


## Original code snippet

You can use regular expressions:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if (em1.matches("524[0-9]{2}646")) {
  // do stuff
}
```
