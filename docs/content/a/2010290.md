How do I get the current date in Java?
In C# it is DateTime.Now.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2010290

Just construct a new Date object without any arguments; this will assign the current date and time to the new object.
In the words of the Javadocs for the zero-argument constructor:
Allocates a Date object and initializes it so that it represents the time at which it was allocated, measured to the nearest millisecond.
Make sure you&#x27;re using java.util.Date and not java.sql.Date -- the latter doesn&#x27;t have a zero-arg constructor, and has somewhat different semantics that are the topic of an entirely different conversation. :)
