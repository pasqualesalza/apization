How do you handle clean up when the program receives a kill signal?
For instance, there is an application I connect to that wants any third party app (my app) to send a finish command when logging out. What is the best say to send that finish command when my app has been destroyed with a kill -9?
edit 1: kill -9 cannot be captured. Thank you guys for correcting me.
edit 2: I guess this case would be when the one calls just kill which is the same as ctrl-c



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2541618

The way to handle this for anything other than kill -9 would be to register a shutdown hook. If you can use (SIGTERM) kill -15 the shutdown hook will work. (SIGINT) kill -2 DOES cause the program to gracefully exit and run the shutdown hooks.
Registers a new virtual-machine
  shutdown hook.
The Java virtual machine shuts down in
  response to two kinds of events:
when the exit (equivalently,
  System.exit) method is invoked, or
interrupt, such as typing ^C, or a
  system-wide event, such as user logoff
  or system shutdown.
I tried the following test program on OSX 10.6.3 and on kill -9 it did NOT run the shutdown hook, didn&#x27;t think it would. On a kill -15 it DOES run the shutdown hook every time.
There isn&#x27;t any way to really gracefully handle a kill -9 in any program.
In rare circumstances the virtual
  machine may abort, that is, stop
  running without shutting down cleanly.
  This occurs when the virtual machine
  is terminated externally, for example
  with the SIGKILL signal on Unix or the
  TerminateProcess call on Microsoft
  Windows.
The only real option to handle a kill -9 is to have another watcher program watch for your main program to go away or use a wrapper script. You could do with this with a shell script that polled the ps command looking for your program in the list and act accordingly when it disappeared.

```java
* The program exits normally, when the last non-daemon thread exits or
* The virtual machine is terminated in response to a user
public class TestShutdownHook
{
    public static void main(final String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread()
