I am reading a book for Java that I am trying to learn, and I have a question. I can&#x27;t understand what is the difference between the variable type char and String. For example, there is a difference between int and short, the bytes at the memory and the area of numbers that they have.
But what is the difference between char and String? except that char use (&#x27;) and &quot;String&quot; (&quot;).
PS: It is my first &quot;real&quot; programming language. (At school I learned a fake-language for the purpose of the programming lesson.)



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/10430082

char is one character. String is zero or more characters.
char is a primitive type. String is a class.
Note the single quotes for char, and double quotes for String.
