I am trying to establish a connection with a PHP script of mine in Java using the secure socket layer (HTTPS), but I have found out that to ensure maximum security/validity I have to import the SSL certificate that my website uses into my application... Something I don&#x27;t know how to do.
If it helps, my SSL Certificate is not self signed, rather provided by StartSSL AND I am using Eclipse IDE.
Could anybody point me in the right direction? i.e. What files do I need, where should I import them and what code do I need in Java, etc?

You are partially right when you make that statement. You do not need to import your SSL certificate. It is sufficient that the StartSSL CA certificate be imported.
Additionally, there is no such thing as importing a certificate into a Java application. SSL support in Java relies on the concept of keystores and truststores, and not on some certificate packaged within your application. If you are publishing your application to be downloaded and executed by end-users, there is no need for your to publish your certificate or for that matter your private key in your application. The private key, and the associated certificate would be stored in a keystore, that only you may access.
The end-users of your application would rely on the SSL support within the Java runtime, that would enable the application to establish SSL connections to sites, after the server-certificate is verified. The Java runtime ships with a default set of CA certificates in a truststore, and the only prerequisite for SSL connections to be successfully established is that the SSL certificate of the server be issued by one of the CAs in the truststore. The certificates of StartSSL are not present in the truststore of the Java runtime, atleast as of version 6, and therefore:
Or, you could initialize your application with your own truststore using the -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=&lt;path_to_truststore&gt; -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=&lt;truststore_password&gt; JVM startup flags, or execute the following code before initializing SSL connections:
This is a viable approach only if your application is a Java SE application that does not happen to be an applet (or an application with similar restrictions on how the truststore is specified).
It would also help to read up the Java keytool documentation.
