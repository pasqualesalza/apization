Is there a simple way (instead of traversing manually all the string, or loop for indexOf) in order to find how many times, a character appears in a string?
Say we have &quot;abdsd3$asda$asasdd$sadas&quot; and we want that $ appears 3 times.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/6100744

This is definitely the fastest way. Regexes are much much slower here, and possible harder to understand.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s = "...";
int counter = 0;
for( int i=0; i<s.length(); i++ ) {
    if( s.charAt(i) == '$' ) {
        counter++;
    } 
}
```
