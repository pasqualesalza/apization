I&#x27;m looking for a way to pull the last characters from a String, regardless of size. Lets take these strings into example:
As you can see, completely random strings, but they have 7 numbers at the end. How would I be able to take those 7 numbers?
Edit:
I just realized that String[] string = s.split(&quot;: &quot;); would work great here, as long as I call string[2] for the numbers and string[1] for anything in the middle.

Lots of things you could do.
will get everything after the last colon.
everything after the last space.
splits off all sequences of digits; the last element of the numbers array is probably what you want.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
s.substring(s.lastIndexOf(':') + 1);
s.substring(s.lastIndexOf(' ') + 1);
String numbers[] = s.split("[^0-9]+");
```
