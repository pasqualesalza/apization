I wrote the following code on immutable Strings.
Output:
Here the value of variable a has been changed (while many say that contents of the immutable objects cannot be changed). But what exactly does one mean by saying String is immutable? Could you please clarify this topic for me?

```java
public class ImmutableStrings {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testmethod();
    }

    private static void testmethod() {
        String a = "a";
        System.out.println("a 1-->" + a);
        a = "ty";
        System.out.println("a 2-->" + a);
    }

a 1-->a  
a 2-->ty

Before proceeding further with the fuss of immutability, let&#x27;s just take a look into the String class and its functionality a little before coming to any conclusion.
This is how String works:
This, as usual, creates a string containing &quot;knowledge&quot; and assigns it a reference str. Simple enough? Lets perform some more functions:
Lets see how the below statement works:
This appends a string &quot; base&quot; to str. But wait, how is this possible, since String objects are immutable? Well to your surprise, it is.
When the above statement is executed, the VM takes the value of String str, i.e. &quot;knowledge&quot; and appends &quot; base&quot;, giving us the value &quot;knowledge base&quot;. Now, since Strings are immutable, the VM can&#x27;t assign this value to str, so it creates a new String object, gives it a value &quot;knowledge base&quot;, and gives it a reference str.
An important point to note here is that, while the String object is immutable, its reference variable is not. So that&#x27;s why, in the above example, the reference was made to refer to a newly formed String object.
At this point in the example above, we have two String objects: the first one we created with value &quot;knowledge&quot;, pointed to by s, and the second one &quot;knowledge base&quot;, pointed to by str. But, technically, we have three String objects, the third one being the literal &quot;base&quot; in the concat statement.
What if we didn&#x27;t have another reference s to &quot;knowledge&quot;? We would have lost that String. However, it still would have existed, but would be considered lost due to having no references.
Look at one more example below
What&#x27;s happening:
The reference variable s1 still refers to the original String &quot;java&quot;.
Almost every method, applied to a String object in order to modify it, creates new String object. So, where do these String objects go? Well, these exist in memory, and one of the key goals of any programming language is to make efficient use of memory.

str = str.concat(" base");
String s1 = "java";
s1.concat(" rules");
System.out.println("s1 refers to "+s1);  // Yes, s1 still refers to "java"
