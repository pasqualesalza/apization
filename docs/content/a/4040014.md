That way the result range is 0..9 without 4 or 6."

In this case, the MAX is only 5, so I could check the duplicates one by one, but how could I do this in a simpler way? For example, what if the MAX has a value of 20?
Thanks.

```java
int MAX = 5;

for (i = 1 , i <= MAX; i++)
{
        drawNum[1] = (int)(Math.random()*MAX)+1;

        while (drawNum[2] == drawNum[1])
        {
             drawNum[2] = (int)(Math.random()*MAX)+1;
        }
        while ((drawNum[3] == drawNum[1]) || (drawNum[3] == drawNum[2]) )
        {
             drawNum[3] = (int)(Math.random()*MAX)+1;
        }
        while ((drawNum[4] == drawNum[1]) || (drawNum[4] == drawNum[2]) || (drawNum[4] == drawNum[3]) )
        {
             drawNum[4] = (int)(Math.random()*MAX)+1;
        }
        while ((drawNum[5] == drawNum[1]) ||
               (drawNum[5] == drawNum[2]) ||
               (drawNum[5] == drawNum[3]) ||
               (drawNum[5] == drawNum[4]) )
        {
             drawNum[5] = (int)(Math.random()*MAX)+1;

The simplest way would be to create a list of the possible numbers (1..20 or whatever) and then shuffle them with Collections.shuffle. Then just take however many elements you want. This is great if your range is equal to the number of elements you need in the end (e.g. for shuffling a deck of cards).
That doesn&#x27;t work so well if you want (say) 10 random elements in the range 1..10,000 - you&#x27;d end up doing a lot of work unnecessarily. At that point, it&#x27;s probably better to keep a set of values you&#x27;ve generated so far, and just keep generating numbers in a loop until the next one isn&#x27;t already present:
