I&#x27;d like to split the sentence and get the last token. I feel my way of doing it is a little too awkward. Basically, I want the second statement to be shorter. Is that possible?
Edit: What I&#x27;m looking for: 1) no need to declare the array separately 2) no need to split the sentence twice. It would be good if there&#x27;s a method called last with array. I suspect this is impossible but want to make sure.
