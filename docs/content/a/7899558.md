What you have should work. If, however, the spaces provided are defaulting to... something else? You can use the whitespace regex:
This will cause any number of consecutive spaces to split your string into tokens.
As a side note, I&#x27;m not sure &quot;splited&quot; is a word :) I believe the state of being the victim of a split is also &quot;split&quot;. It&#x27;s one of those tricky grammar things :-) Not trying to be picky, just figured I&#x27;d pass it on!

```java
str = "Hello I'm your String";
String[] splited = str.split("\\s+");
```
