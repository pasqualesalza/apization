I followed about 10 different tutorials and none of them seemed to do the trick, my runnable jar file just isn&#x27;t working.
My game runs fine when I run it in eclipse, and I was able to make it into a runnable jar file that worked only a day or two ago and have not changed too much code.  When I try to run the .jar a java icon pops up at the bottom of my screen but then nothing happens.
It&#x27;s my launcher is failing to open (if I run without launcher it works fine), there are no errors wether I open with terminal or eclipse.
I&#x27;m using a mac if that helps...
Here are screen shots that I took of the exact steps I took



Some warnings I got (I think they are only because of unused variables, I got this message earlier when I was able to get my .jar to work)

This appears that the top of my screen along with the java icon at the bottom, but nothing else happens.

-Thanks

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16702670

I assume you&#x27;re making a GUI application, and launching the Jar by clicking on it?  Many times if a GUI application has an error at startup, it doesn&#x27;t visibly do anything, like pop an error message, because it hasn&#x27;t had a chance to build any sort of GUI to report the error to yet.  I would guess that something you changed causes an exception at startup, and that message is not visible because you&#x27;re launching the jar by clicking on it.
If you run the Jar from the terminal instead (spotlight: &quot;terminal&quot;) you will be able to see the stack trace that&#x27;s preventing your Jar from running, and hopefully that will help you debug further.
You can also try to catch the exception in your main method and display a GUI alert, however this doesn&#x27;t work if the exception is raised before the main method starts (e.g. during class loading). In other words it&#x27;s a nice-to-have, but doesn&#x27;t totally solve the problem. You may still need to run the Jar from the command line.

```java
$ cd directory/of/jar
$ java -jar name_of_jar.jar
  .... stack trace should appear here, or program should run
public static void main(String[] args) {
  try {
    // body of main method goes here, including any other error handling
  } catch (Throwable t) {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(
        null, t.getClass().getSimpleName() + ": " + t.getMessage());
    throw t; // don't suppress Throwable
  }
}
