I am getting the current date (in format 12/31/1999 i.e. mm/dd/yyyy) as using the below code:
and I am having another date in format as: 2010-08-25 (i.e. yyyy/mm/dd) ,
so I want to find the difference between date in number of days, how do I find difference in days?
(In other words, I want to find the difference between CURRENT DATE - yyyy/mm/dd formatted date)

Not really a reliable method, better of using JodaTime
Here&#x27;s an approximation...
To Parse the date from a string, you could use
Although, since you&#x27;re sure of the date format...
You Could also do Integer.parseInt() on it&#x27;s Substrings to obtain their numeric values.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Calendar thatDay = Calendar.getInstance();
  thatDay.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,25);
  thatDay.set(Calendar.MONTH,7); // 0-11 so 1 less
  thatDay.set(Calendar.YEAR, 1985);

  Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();

  long diff = today.getTimeInMillis() - thatDay.getTimeInMillis(); //result in millis
long days = diff / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
String strThatDay = "1985/08/25";
  SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/dd");
  Date d = null;
  try {
   d = formatter.parse(strThatDay);//catch exception
  } catch (ParseException e) {
   // TODO Auto-generated catch block
   e.printStackTrace();
  } 


  Calendar thatDay = Calendar.getInstance();
  thatDay.setTime(d); //rest is the same....
```
