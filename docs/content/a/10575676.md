I have a string that I load throughout my application, and it changes from numbers to letters and such. I have a simple if statement to see if it contains letters or numbers but, something isn&#x27;t quite working correctly. Here is a snippet.
Although the text variable does contain letters, the condition returns as true. The and &amp;&amp; should eval as both conditions having to be true in order to process the number = text;
==============================
Solution:
I was able to solve this by using this following code provided by a comment on this question. All other post are valid as well!
What I used that worked came from the first comment. Although all the example codes provided seems to be valid as well!


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String text = "abc"; 
String number; 

if (text.contains("[a-zA-Z]+") == false && text.length() > 2) {
    number = text; 
}
String text = "abc"; 
String number; 

if (Pattern.matches("[a-zA-Z]+", text) == false && text.length() > 2) {
    number = text; 
}
```


## Original code snippet

If you&#x27;ll be processing the number as text, then change:
to:
Instead of checking that the string doesn&#x27;t contain alphabetic characters, check to be sure it contains only numerics.
If you actually want to use the numeric value, use Integer.parseInt() or Double.parseDouble() as others have explained below.
As a side note, it&#x27;s generally considered bad practice to compare boolean values to true or false.  Just use if (condition) or if (!condition).

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
if (text.contains("[a-zA-Z]+") == false && text.length() > 2){
if (text.matches("[0-9]+") && text.length() > 2) {
```
