Let&#x27;s say I have the following code:
All I wanted to do was to write something in a text file, in my case &quot;Some text here for a reason&quot;. Then to read data from my file, and finally to change my text from my file from &quot;Some text here for a reason&quot; in &quot;Some text there for a reason&quot;. I ran the code but all it happens is to write in my file &quot;Some text here for a reason&quot;.
I tried to figure out what could be wrong in my code, but unfortunately it was in vain. Any advice or rewrite is highly appreciated from me.

## Original code snippet

Change your code to that:
The Problem is that you are calling br.readLine() twice which is provoking the application to read  line1 and then line2 and in your case you have just one line which means that your program read it in the conditional form and when it comes to declaring it to the variable verify, it is stopping because you don&#x27;t have anymore data to read your file.
